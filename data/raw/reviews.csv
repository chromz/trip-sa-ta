40,"The location is perfect with easy access to surrounding areas and main center. Strong wifi.  Express services.  Very very respectful and professional staff.  Amazing breakfast.  All facilities that you want are there. SPA, GYM, pool, gift&grocery shop, vending machines, business centre, Cafe and restaurants. Room was clean, tidy and spacious. Noticed in rooms that no enough power sockets to use and only one near the bed.. always in Barceló chain of Hotels the provide USB connections in the room, however its not available in this Hotel. Faced a big issue of water disconnection from 1 pm to 8 pm which was bad. "
50,"Barcelo Guatemala City was everything I expected. I wanted to stay a safe place with all facilities, so I did not need to go outside during the day I spent there. Two gyms, pool, beauty salon and bars/restaurants. Fast wifi, comfortable big room and fast service. I really can recommend this hotel. Free airport transfer even at 4 in the morning!"
50,"This is a well run hotel in a convenient location, the staff are taking all sensible precautions during difficult times and being very kind to stranded travellers. The swimming pool is clean and a haven of distraction for slightly concerned and bored guests. We are happy to continue to be offered room service when all restaurants have to be closed."
50,"Excellent breakfast buffet; Giovanni and all of them treated me light a king.  They are very polite and fast.  My room phone was out of order and in 10 minutes was ready.  The Room service very good, nice and polite."
20,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel; here the issues we experienced:  1-Bathroom door didn’t close  2-Breakfast is basically bunch of fried stuff (bacon was like eating a sandal)  3-Second night next room guest were really loud till 3 am, went down to reception to get some help and they didn’t do anything at all (their solution was to move us to another room at 3 AM, had to pack all our stuff back without any help) 4-We came back after check out (1 pm) to wait for our flight (10:30 pm) and when we asked for use the pool to make some time while we wait they did not allow us just saying “no, only guest” when we already stayed 2 nights as mentioned before!!!! 5-also hotel facilities looks old and lack of maintenance  When u pay more than $250 for 2 nights u are expecting to have a"
20,"The only positive point of this hotel is the owner, he is very attentive and helpfull, gave us a lot of recommendations and was always ready for whatever we could need.   The location is not good, far from the turistic points and not very safe. The building is very old, needs an urgent renovation. The bathroom has a bad small and the bed sheets are old and worn.  Breakfast is ok."
40,"This hostel is a little away from things in Guatemala. We walked about 25 mins to get to the main square area. Plaza Barrios is not too far, about a 10 minute walk. Here we found supermarkets, bakeries, food stands, clothes sellers etc. It is a safe walk during the day anyway, not so sure about night time.  The owner of the hostel, Ambrosio, was friendly, helpful and kind. We booked our shuttle with him to go to Antigua. It picked us up at the hostel and cost $10 each.  The hostel is a little on the dated side but clean and adequate. The kitchen is great to cook in. It is very quiet at night so we both slept well.  You can pay your bill by card, there is a 3% charge on it. "
40,"Very clean, with free breakfast and kitchen. Staff is so so kind, loved that! Was good for a quick one night in the city.   Breakfast was eggs, plantain and juice. And bread.   Shower did get quite warm after a few minutes of heating up. This was great.   Great wifi"
50,"This place is not easy to find, and I speak Spanish. However, it's excellent! It's two blocks from a bus station called Estación Plaza Borrina. If you can get there, it's a lot easier to find!   I have stayed in a number of hostels, and this is one of my favorites. I felt like a guest in the house, rather than someone staying in a hostel! They have lockers, WiFi, throw in free breakfast, are close to the city center, and are also close to some markets that are very reasonably priced! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
50,"The rooms were very clean and the owner was very friendly. Made breakfast for guests in the morning and was very helpful with finding activities around Guatemala City. Some areas in Zone 1 are dangerous, but the area around the hotel is very safe. Has a nice rooftop balcony. Would definitely recommend!"
50,"This was my 5th stay at Casa de Familia in the past 7 yrs. Each time I visit Guaetemala I schedule time at Casa de Familia with Gilda for transportation from the airport, home cooked meals, and personalized touring. This time she planned a visit to Xela and then Panajachel at a spa hotel. We also enjoyed a boat ride to Santa Catarina and a walking tour around the village. I could not travel as I do without Gilda to make arrangements and translate for me. She considers EVERYTHING! Looking forward to visiting again in the future."
50,"I have stayed at Casa de Familia twice before this trip. This trip had special considerations as I would be visiting a family a couple of hours away by car and also wanted to visit other areas of Guatemala. Casa de Familia made it so simple for me! I provided a list of my requests by email and we worked through the plans prior to my arrival. Everything went as planned from picking me up at the airport, to connecting me with my friends and then back to Casa de Familia for a couple days of touring.  Our trip to Santa Teresita Thermal Spa at Lake Amatitlan was amazing! I provided a shopping list of items (gifts, coffee, etc.) which was filled and waiting for me. Gilda's expertise, connections, and translating were so valuable to me.  I was traveling solo, however, it seemed like I"
50,"I stayed at Casa de Familia overnight on my way to una escuela in Xela, Guatemala.  The room was comfortable and clean with a lock on the door (which really isn't necessary since Gilda is your family!).  I had my own bathroom complete with a nice hot shower!  I was not concerned about location because I was really only there en route to Xela; as a matter of fact, after our Habitat Build, my husband and I stayed there again, again, just for the night as we had an early flight out the next morning.  While you might hear that GC is not the safest place to stay, Casa de Familia is in a secure, gated neighbourhood.  I was not concerned with safety at all.  The best part about staying with Gilda is that she TOTALLY takes care of you!  She picked me up at the airport after midnight"
50,"My friend and I stayed with Gilda for three nights in Dec. 2014. She is charming, accommodating and very knowledgeable. Her home is very secure and located relatively close to the airport (where she picked us up and dropped us off). We hired her as a guide for 2 days and she took us everywhere we wanted to go, making helpful suggestions as well. Terrific breakfasts and if you are learning Spanish she is a patient teacher. This  is a wonderful, hassle-free way to see some of Guatemala City, a place with lovely museums but a bad reputation for safety."
40,From airport to Casa de Familia for a short stay  made my first visit to Guatemala a perfect start. I was warmly welcomed and got a very good room facing the quiet garden in a safe surrounding. the hostess speaks both English and Spanish.
50,"I stayed here with my partner, our baby, and a friend and her child in a two bedroom two bath apartment room for a week in April. I found it on Airbnb but you can book through hotel booking sites as well. We loved it! The amount of space you get for the money is amazing and a great choice for a longer stay. The common areas are beautiful! The breakfast is not as big as the bigger hotels but plenty and good. The customer service is wonderful. Everyone was so helpful the entire time. It does seem like some rooms are more updated than others so you may want to ask about that when booking. Location is perfect. We would definitely return."
50,"I visited this hotel and was very pleased with my visit. From the time I walked in every single worker was very nice, polite, helpful and friendly. Breakfast was included and yummy! Had a choice of Guatemalan or American options, cooks very very nice. Hotel has a home feel, beautiful gardens and very well kept/clean pool. Beds were so comfortable, not all rooms have AC but there is a big fan for the room with no AC. My only complaint would have to be internet connection, it wasn’t the greatest but not a huge deal. "
50,"This hotel has been for us as a family like a home when we come to stay in Guatemala every two years or so. The service is amazing, always ready to help with anything and with a smile. The rooms (specially the apartments) are modern and clean. Breakfast is included in the price and delicious! They offer the shuttle service to the airport. The area is full of restaurants and bars which makes it a bit noisy over the weekends but there are double glazed windows and you can hardly hear anything. I really recommend this hotel."
50,"Best hotel/apartment for families traveling with anyone, but especially  young children. Mine are 11, 7 and 5 and they all found something they loved about it. The hotel had a great pool, hot tub, a game room with pool table and ping pong, and a fuseball (sp?) table. There was a mix-up with my reservation at first, but they bent over backwards to work it out so I could be comfortable and managed to stay the whole time. Great and safe location. My kids and I walked around during the day and night to eat and it was great. It's within two walks to Oakland Mall (amazing!) and hotel staff is available for anything you need them for. We were able to do our laundry for $5 dollars a load. Expensive but convenient and super easy. Hotel is always being cleaned and there is always security"
50,"This is my second time at this hotel, and I definitely will come back. This place is fabulous and has everything you need and more. We stayed in a fabulous suite with two large bedrooms and couldn't be happier. The bathrooms are huge too, and very clean. As I was traveling with a baby and a toddler, I can say we all enjoyed the big space so much, instead of being in a typical four-wall hotel room. The kitchen and living room are very comfortable and allowed to prepare some meals for the little ones. It has a great playground with swings and slides and a pool. Breakfast is really good, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Great location, close to good restaurants and bars. Perfect for families. I recommend it 100%"
30,"The hotel was used by a mission team that I lead.  It was convenient to our work.  Provided adequate low cost meals.  Seemed very safe due to armed guard.  The rooms are very basic with a bed and a shower and pitchers of water.  There may have been a television, but no time to watch.  There is no elevator if that is a necessity."
50,"In a course of a two weeks Guatemala roundtrip I had the chance to stay in the Hotel Royal Palace for four nights in total. The hotel is not only perfectly located in the centre of cultural activities with the lively 6th Avenue, two Basilicas as well as the Palace, cathedral and central plaza within 7 minutes of walking, the hotel itself was worth the stay. The rooms are clean and spacious, the breakfast was plenty and delicious and at some days there was live music and Marimba in the lobby nad people start to dance during breakfast and lunch, At the bar I could participate at a karaoke night and got to know some interesting Latin music. To conclude, it was a delightful stay at the Hotel and I can't wait to check in again, whenever I am in Guatemala City."
50,"The rooms were clean, beds comfortable, and breakfast excellent. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the street and slept comfortably with the windows open. The rooms are not air conditioned, but it isn't really necessary. Bathrooms clean and well-stocked.Some Spanish is necessary for communicating with the front desk, and airport shuttle does not run on Sundays."
40,"This is a comfortable, spotlessly clean hotel with very good service. The bed was great and the shower excellent.The breakfast menu was varied and delicious and we were able to ask for just fruit and toast. Our one issue was the recommendation that we do not go out on our own because of security concerns. "
40,"We flew in and spent the night. The driver was right in front to pick us up at the airport, spoke good English and was very friendly. We were starving dinner was good reasonable prices, breakfast included with room rate (as was airport shuttle) Our room was nice and clean. We wanted to see the historic district and the ""Central Mercado""."
40,"We had a quick turn around so we were only at this hotel for about 7 hours to sleep. We arrived at night so I don't really know much about the surrounding area but the hotel was NICE!! We had been traveling around to little village towns and this was the best hotel on our trip. The beds were super comfortable and the wifi was fast unlike all the other hotels we had been in. Room service food was good but it took a while because they were closing when we arrived and then everyone in our large group of 35 ordered food. My room had a great layout however I heard in other rooms it was weird like the bathroom door couldn't open all the way due to a bed being in the way. Lobby looked nice and staff was nice! My only complaint was that I couldn't get hot or warm water in the shower, it"
30,My wife and I stayed here just after New Years in 1976 while backpacking and still occasionally yell llave which means key. At that time you had to ask for your room to be unlocked. They wanted to keep things safe from theft by controlling who had keys. It was a wonderful experience.
20,"This hotel is quite expensive but the stay wasn't worht it. The rooms, beds, showers and so were perfectly good and luxurous, but the rest was very dissapointing. The breakfeast that is included consits of only one meal to make you full. The food was bad and not enough to make you full. E.g. your breakfeast could be to dry pancakes and a little bit of tasteless scramble eggs served with a juice that tasted disgusting. The staff was not really interested in their guests at all. We had a feeling that we were just another number for them. The gardens were pretty but you couldn't really enjoy because there were no table to sit at. Furthermore the jaquizi didn't function."
50,I stay at this hostel every time I fly into or out of Guatemala city. It is conveniently located within walking distance from the airport. The owners are friendly and very accommodating. Free breakfast was served with our overnight stay. They offer free wifi and pure drinking water for filling water bottles. Rooms are clean and can accommodate 1 or 6 with shared bathroom facilities. Great for small groups.   
40,"I was picked up at the airport after great communication via email regarding my arrival. I found this service very helpful. The hostel is very close to the airport. Breakfast is included. The room was sparse, but clean and the bed was very comfortable. The entire place felt very comfortable to me. They took me to the airport both mornings I stayed with them, once to find a shuttle to the lake and again to catch my returning flight. We took an Uber to a nearby mall and walked about a half mile from there to a restaurant.The staff was kind and helpful. I will stay here again for future trips."
50,Every time my parents and I go to Guatemala this is the place to stay.I come back here since 1985. we visit different places of the country and never feel more secure than when I stay in Pension Meza. its not one of this fancy hotels but is welcoming. The owners are super nice and the people friendly. I have meet lots of people there and have great memories and I will create more. last time there the owners start remodeling the place now every room has a private bathroom. The room where the famous Che' stay will stay the same. that is a legend.That room is part of the charm of this place.the hotel is very well located. and the ownwer pick you up at the airport if you need.
40,"If you plan on staying in Guatemala City and want to experience a pension with a real grassroots flavor situated in the heart of Downtown, the inimitable Pension Meza is the perfect place for you.  From the outside its instantly forgettable, though once you enter, you enter an environment that is part modern art gallery, part grassroots unchic and part steeped in Central American/Caribbean political history.  There are less than 20 rooms, some with private baths, most with shared baths surrounding the open air courtyard. The rooms are extremely basic, finished in dilapidated beds and worn out tables and chairs. But each room, virtually every square inch is covered with detailed drawings and paintings done by artistically inclined residents that have accumulated over the years."
30,"This place is perfectly located to explore zone 1. If you arrive on Linea Dorada, it's in walking distance from the bus station. It's not the cleanest or nicest place I've ever stayed, but it serves the purpose of being DT Guatemala City. Very centrally located. Dorms have lockers and there's a hot shower. Super chill place."
50,stayed there a month. The people there were so helpful and nice. I will be moving to Guatemala soon and will visit my escape  often.. Walking distance to the pres palace and lots of churches around. If you do get stuck in Guatemala city this is a very safe place. Happy traveling. Now a private room was 50q's or share a 3 person room was 30 q's.
30,"I liked many things about the Plaza. Customer service is great and the restaurant was good too--we liked the included breakfast and we ate dinner there as well, which was also good. The room was huge and the place is kept very well maintained. And it was all for a very good price.  If a pool is your thing, the Plaza is the place to go. There is a gem of a swimming pool, with tables, chairs, and a small bar to hang out at; and two slides.   The area was the only thing that was a bit on the edge. We had a view of a permanent camp out on a street corner of a group of homeless folks, and we were hassled while waiting for a ride right outside of the hotel. Once inside the hotel, however, it's extremely safe, with a locked gate monitored around the clock by security."
40,Great stay with a large group or family. The room we were in had 6 beds. Other rooms had 3 and 4 beds. Breakfast is included. Beds were comfortable. The staff is very friendly.   My friends and I enjoyed watching Nacho Liebre on the TV in Spanish.   :)
50,"Our stay here couldn't have been better! We were picked up from the airport on arrival at no cost, and the owner dropped us off to the airport the next day at 4:30 am also at no cost! The hosts were so lovely. As we were missing the included breakfast due to the early start, they offered to cook it up for our dinner - eggs, beans, cheese, plantain and bread/corn crackers +coffee/tea. Delish!  The private room with ensuit was everything we needed, clean and comfortable. Good hot water for the shower, good Wi-Fi, quiet, could hardly hear the planes. It literally is 1 min away from the airport! We also saw the dorms which looked great too. We would definitely stay again. "
30,"This was the most expensive stay while traveling for one month in Central America! For 60+ USD the double room was pretty basic. We had to pay for a breakfast we didn't even want, because we were flying out at 6am the next morning. The shuttle service to the airport was also sth in the range of 20 USD. For a 5 minute car ride. The only time on our journey when we felt being ripped off."
50,"Angie is a wonderful, knowledgeable hostess that runs a very simple, clean and adequate guest house on the edge of Zona 10. You are several blocks from all the popular restaurants but it's easy to ride around thanks to Uber. We had the front room which we found perfectly fine. There was some street noise but not enough to disturb our sleep. There are kitchen facilities available to guests who prefer to eat in. We will definitely go back and recommend Angie's to anyone on a budget."
50,"I stayed here last night, had a long day of travelling and was pretty knackered when I got in. The taxi was there to meet me as arranged and my room was quiet and really clean. Paulinho behind the desk got me a charger cos I had the wrong adaptor and was just really friendly. The breakfast is wicked and all the staff are so nice. I don't think you can look too much further than this place for a safe, clean first night in Guatemala. Thanks Villa Toscana, top people! "
50,"Villa Toscana exceeded our expectations! It is located in a guarded and gated area, so safety is paramount to them. It is just around the corner from the airport. Food delivered to the hotel was good and there was a great variety. Prices were in line with regular restaurant meals.The room was very comfortable - we had a terrace with views of the volcanoes and a king sized bed. We ate the complimentary breakfast in a very attractive garden. There were numerous hot and cold choices. The staff were excellent. We'll go back again!"
40,"You get what you are looking for: right outside of the airport, the hotel provides shuttle to and from the international terminal and they only charge for it if you need to leave before 5 am. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable enough for one night and very clean. "
50,"The hotel is very close to the airport, but walking is not something I would recommend. Take a short cab ride and you'll be there in moments, depending on the time of day because downtown Guatemala City traffic can be horrendous.  I stayed in a clean room on the 2nd floor. It was very secure and clean. The bathroom was small but I was alone so it was fine.   The staff were all super nice and accommodating. I don't speak Spanish but they all spoke very good English to help me understand. The manager Azucena was very helpful, but Sergio, Nelson & Paulino were as well. I had to make a last minute change to the dates I was staying there and normally that means a fee wouod be charged, but they heloed me without charging me a cancellation/change fee. That was so much appreciated! I"
40,"I stayed here last week and was super impressed.  The hotel arranged for a driver to pick me up at the airport with a sign, which was comforting to see since I had traveled all day from the US all alone.  The hotel is literally a one minute drive from GUA airport.  The next morning they served us our breakfast of choice-- I got oatmeal with bananas and brown sugar.  My friend got an egg plate with included amazing refried black beans.  I spoke with another guest and they said it was BY FAR the nicest hotel they had stayed at in all of Guatemala.  I paid apx $86 for a king bed."
50,"Let's say you are going to Guatemala City, and you need a nice room. There are some pricey hotels in Zona 10, but you don't need pricey. What you need is a comfortable bed and some coffee, maybe a beer.  Check out Suites Reforma.  That staff are the best--tour advice and arrangements, personal service, and friendly.  I have stayed at the Suites Reforma many times."
30,"I spent a couple of weeks at this place with my wife. It has all of the necessities and a cool, funny vibe with furniture and accessories left over from the 60s and 70s. The apartments are clean but the WiFi access is absolutely terrible! I had more or less consistent service at the desk but weak or no access from the bedroom or kitchen. The restaurant is similarly lackluster. Also, be prepared for the hustle and bustle of La Reforma - never a quite moment. You can do much better in Zone 10 for about the same price."
20,"What a dump.First let me say that all the staff are friendly.Internet is the worst,when you complain,their excuse is,one day is the rain,next is the wind,earthquakes,act of God or what have you.The kitchen would never pass minimum standards for safety,or higiene anywhere on the Planet.Noisy place,mainly from lack of respect from traffic and thugs revving their bikes and cars at 2am.Will never stay at this low low low grade 4 star,can you imagine,4 star joint.Check in at your own risk"
50,"good location, safe area of the city has restaurants nearby and pubs The hotel staff became my tour guide, really they know the city very well and the rest of the country.  breakfast is good  The hotel is clean"
50,"This hotel is home away from home. I have stayed there on many occasions and recommend it to everyone. Exceptional staff. In a very safe area , favorable for taking walks while breathing the crisp Guatemalan air"
10,"Where to start? Just after the free cancellation period had ended, they raised the price without any explanation whatsoever. When asked they basically said ""Booking did it, pay or leave."" Our ""room"" was a windowless closet full of cob webs off the smoking and trash area and smelled the part. The bathroom was right next to our room and with the walls and doors being thin as they are, I literally woke up to the sound of somebody doing his big business at 5:15 am. Bathroom was tiny (I couldn't turn around without having to open the door) and filthy with nowhere to hang stuff. I guess they expect you to park your clean underwear on the toilet that's covered in hair?  Cigarette butts all over the floor in the yard, cockroaches as well. You don't get a key for the front door, so you"
30,"The staff is very friendly. The bed was clean but not really comfy. We felt relatively safe. They have lockers, hot showers and plenty of bathrooms.    My one issues is they don’t enforce rules. There were people smoking even though the signs say no smoking.  There was partying until am and people talking loudly at 3am in our room.  Price is good but don’t expect much sleep"
50,"We were very well received by the staff and everyone in the Hostal was very nice!  The place is very nicely kept, very clean and the breakfast is wonderful!  I recommend this place because is a  very good deal for the money and very close to center, walking distance 5min!  Gracias Hostal Rocio 👍"
50,"Very good central location, good breakfast, personalized attention. I will be back! Very good!!! I was pleased with the attention, a few blocks from the national palace and central park more sotre and restaunts."
30,So many bathrooms and most are set up in an unworkable manner. The toilet is so close to the door that knees touch the door. There is literally no room to turn around and grab the TP on the back of the toilet tank. There is NO sink in that bano to wash hands after using the toilet. There is barely room to climb over the toilet and into the shower. In another bathroom the light for the room is INSIDE the shower stall which is located at the far end of the room. Getting in or out of the shower means you have to shimmy past the toilet with about 6 inches of navigating space. Showers need more frequent cleaning as there was hair and toenails visible. Pillows are hard-could they be filled with sawdust? Kitchen available for your use. Tipico restaurant around undo the corner. Grocery
50,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It's located in one of the best areas in Guatemala City. The hotel is like B&B style, and the staff were nice. There are gates that are always locked, and they just open them to let someone in or out. Wi Fi was fast"
50,Glad I found this small hotel in a quiet neighborhood. The staff was very accomodating and the room very clean. Bed was comfortable and remote-controlled air conditioning was handy at times. They serve a very nice breakfast - just let them know you'll be staying for breakfast.
40,"from booking.com pic, it seems good, open balcony, blue sky, but actually where I get to here, a little disappointed, it's not a good location, look quiet and backland, anyway I enjoy in the room with my friends. love it."
50,"Arrived at 5am on Thursday morning, despite our booking being on Friday. He only charged us for one night as well. Very well run hostel. Would highly recommend given the competitive pricing and homely feel of the place. Good location too, in the middle of zone 1 within touching distance of nice restaurants and the central markets/cathedral etc "
50,"We stayed at this hostel for 2 nights. Our rooms are nice. The owner Ambrosio,sorry if not good write, He supernice, hospitable and helpfull, the sweetest person you'll ever meet :),we agree with Valeria A. We had very tasty breakfast. We had sun beach on top this hotel. We are celebrat unusually New Year. The Owner  gave a lot of information that was very useful for walking around the city. Thanks to him was very happy to stay at this hotel."
40,We only stayed here one night as we were on our way to Antigua and it was perfect for  a stopover. The room and bathroom were clean and the beds were comfy enough. The breakfast is pretty simple but it was fine. Roberto is super helpful and when we were leaving he drew us a map to explain where we could get the bus to Antigua from which was great.
50,"Roberto went above and beyond from the minute we arrived. One of our party left his phone in the taxi and Roberto spent this morning phoning around and eventually retrieved the phone. He then gave us great advice on the city and what to do. The rooms were basic but had everything, the beds were comfy, showers hot and powerful. The location was good and we felt safe the entire time. Recommended. "
10,"Habíamos reservado una habitación con baño y al llegar habían decidido dar nuestra habitación a otros. Nos remitieron a otro hotel más caro y con baño compartido. No es serio, al comunicárnoslo en la calle de noche recién llegados al país. Quedamos en desventaja al no poder buscar otra cosa. "
50,"I stayed 3 different nights within 12 days in Barcelo hotel Guatemala city. Great service, friendly staff, excellent amenities, excellent gift/souvenir shop. They have a gm and a pool. There a supermarket around the corner. The rooms are large and quiet my only (minor) gripe is the buffet breakfast could be better"
50,Everyone was helpful and the hotel was clean and roomy. The hotel has a good location. There are several restaurants in the hotel and the service is excellent. I would recommend the Barcelo to anyone needing one or two nights in Guatemala City.
50,"I always stay here when I come to Guatemala (5+ times) and I have always had a very pleasant experience. The hotel staff are helpful and friendly, and there are good options to eat and have a drink. The rooms are pleasant and are quite clean, no complaints here."
30,"I was here 2 years ago and loved it. This time: not enough towels, no wash cloths, one hand towel for four peeps. Our view was the street. Water in the shower turned from cold to scalding hot to cold to scalding. I was sure looking forward to that shower after being w/o hot water for two weeks. The water in the sink spurted out like it was under pressure.  The business office was kind and helpful printing out maps to a Chinese restaurant. The pool was outstanding and the kids loved it. Comfortable beds with down pillows. We ordered take-out from the hamburger restaurant downstairs. It was ok.   My flight was at 2 am. When I checked-in, I asked about where To catch the shuttle at that time of day. The person at the business office told me that the shuttle didn’t run from 11 PM to"
40,"We were satisfied with our booking here, although it was nothing to write home about.  We stayed in one of the executive level rooms with lounge access.  The service was excellent both at the front desk and the business center.  Abner stood out as very gracious and helpful.  Rooms were spacious and comfortable enough, albeit a little dated.  Everything felt a little bit old, in particular the bathroom.  Lots of restaurant options.  Outdoor pool area is quite nice.  We visited the executive lounge both in the morning and in the evening.  The lounge was also dated--looked like it hadn't been refreshed for about 15 years.  But there were newspapers (Spanish-language, as well as a two-page printout of news in English) and a decent selection of food and drink.  The morning selection"
50,"I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem by the airport.  I reserved online and quickly got a confirmation email. My flight got in late so I was a little unsure.  There was a man with my name on a sign waiting for me as I exited the airport.  He was very pleasant even though it was past 1 AM.  The ride from the airport was very quick, just a couple minutes.  He helped get me with 3 heavy bags into my room right away, told me to pay in the morning and left me to rest.  The room was clean and quite nice considering the great budget price.  Coffee in the morning was strong and plentiful with warmed milk on the side. A very nice continental breakfast with an big plate of fresh fruit followed.  I really liked Patricia's and will use them in the future anytime I need to stay in"
50,"They picked  me Up at the airport, my flight arrived around 10:30pm so it was good to have them take me straight to my hotel. Breakfast was delicious and healthy. They Exchange dollars to Quetzal too so that was great and convenient for me."
40,It's a small B & B- Hostel  near the airport which includes transfers to and from the airport as well as a great cup of coffee and breakfast. For the money you can't beat it! The WIFI is excellent there. Everyone there is so friendly and accommodating.
40,"We briefly graced a bed at this hotel, having arrived in GUA at 8pm and back to the airport at 5am the following morning so its hard to comment in much detail.  The airport pick up and drop off where extremely convenient, the room we had was spacious and clean with a shared bathroom (also fine)."
50,"In one email I was confirmed with a ride from the airport, 1 overnight, breakfast, and ride to the bus station the next morning all for $28 US or credit card with 8% payable when I got there. The room included filtered water, Internet, plugin for my iPhone, a fan, fresh towel, and a double bed.  Shared bath down the hall.  Chain lock on door. Alberto met me outside of customs late in the evening holding a sign with my name on it.  Our ride was a van.  Albert helped with luggage and was a safe driver.  He informed me about breakfast and what time to leave for ride to bus station early enough to buy a ticket to Rio Dulce. Breakfast was coffee, cut fruit with no skin, toast with butter and jam. Patricia was friendly and steered me towards Alberta who spoke English well. The"
50,"This place is fabulous. When we got to our room, our daughters asked if we had the right room. There was a full kitchen, dining room, living room, and 2 large bedrooms along with a great view.   Staff was very friendly & helpful setting up complimentary shuttle to the airport. Speaking of which the complimentary breakfast for the 4 of us was wonderful with many options including an omelette station.   Used the hot tub but not the kids area/pool since it was pretty cold outside. Also, did not order from the room service menu as it was limited and fairly expensive. Plenty of options close by to dine or to take out.  Location was walking distance to many restaurants and shops in Zone 10 along with the Gallo Christmas display (seasonal obviously). Never felt any danger walking"
40,"I really liked this hotel, location couldn't be better. The junior suite I stayed in had two separated rooms, a kitchen, living room and a very spacious bathroom. Everything was clean. I do have to say the suite needs more a/c, there's only one in the main bedroom. Breakfast was very good. I loved that it has a nice pool and a playground for kids. since I was on a business/family trip, this was great for my toddler, instead of having her in the room watching tv."
50,"We were very happy with the Casa Serena. It is one of the smaller hotels in the area, but really has everything you need. The rooms are huge: great for families. Guatemala City gets has a lot of bad rap, but it, actually, has quite a bit to see, and Casa Serena gives you a nice home in town to stay. The immediate neighbourhood is, I guess, as good as it gets in that city: perhaps, not quite charming, but, certainly, comfortable, full of restaurants/shopping and reasonably safe. If traveling with family, I can hardly think of a better place in town. My only (minor) advice would be to improve on the breakfast variety: it is not bad, but somewhat limited (bigger hotels in the area really do much better in my experience). "
40,"Pros: -The hotel's installations are good and well maintained. -The apartments are very spacious and have everything you need for your stay. - It is within walking distance to Oakland mall, shops, and restaurants.   Cons:  - Complementary car service is ""complementary"" depending on who you talk to at the hotel; I talked to 3 different people and they said it was and had always been complementary. However, when the manager (Vidal) he said it was never complementary and that each service (even around the corner) was U$17.    - Food is very expensive. The room service is Four Seasons type of prices.  - Breakfast is only included for 2 people per apartment. - There is no elevator. - Some of the rooms have windows at the bathroom where people from the next building can easily se you."
50,"I stayed here for 6 weeks, in Guatemala for work. The apartments were well equipped and the grounds were very pleasant & relaxing.  Unfortunately I only got to use the spa pool / Jacuzzi once. Excellent choice for breakfast every morning, from healthy fruit & muesli etc, to eggs & more traditional central American beans, plantains etc. Staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The only disadvantage was the noise from rather loud places nearby, so I would suggest a room at the back."
30,"Let me speak straight: this is an average hotel. It is clean, reasonably safe, and provide basic amenities like free wifi in the room (a little bit slow, by the way), hair dryer, and so. Don't expect a safe box in the room, or a mini bar. But it is quiet, although its location in a main avenue. And the airport is less than twenty minutes away by car. However, the room rate is too high. For the same price you can find better hotels in Guatemala zona 10."
30,"Not out first choice, but it is next to the airport. We arrived and were met with a heavily armed security guard, welcome to Guatemala... At the welcome desk there was no one around, so we had to ask the security guard to call a receptionist. An employee eventually appeared, very disheveled....   On to the rooms. Not bad but not great."
50,Stayed here a few days great location friendly staff. Food was very good.  Would definitely stay again.  Decent area of town from what we were told.  Not far away from business district.  Couple nice markets close by as well. 
40,"GUATEMALA CITY HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL – Feb. 2017 4-stars We stayed at this hotel for one night because it was near Hedman Alas’ bus terminal, which we had to be at early in the morning. Knowing we could easily arrange taxi service from the hotel to the bus station was a plus for us. This is a typical American hotel. The room was spacious, the bathroom nice, and the beds comfortable. There is an elevator for taking luggage to the upper floors and seemed to be 24-hour front desk service. My only complaint relates to an email we sent asking that no cleaning products be used the day of our arrival due to my wife’s chemical sensitivity. We did not get a response and the request was not attended to. Fortunately, the room “fragrance” was manageable for my wife."
40,"I picked The Howard Johnson Inn Guatemala City for the fact of its being within walking distance of the Museo Popol Vuh and Museo Ixchel de Traje Indigena.  (They're about a 20 minute walk.)  It wasn't a bad place to be for exploring the Zona 1 as the TransMetro takes you there in about 20 minutes.  Really I have no serious complaints; it's a pleasant enough business hotel. My only reason for not ranking higher:  The fitness area is pretty small and the restaurant staff seemed sometimes overwhelmed by the number of customers, resulting in slow service on occasion.  By & large, I was happy with my choice to stay here."
50,"Gilda is EXTREMELY accommodating.  I used Casa de Familia as a base camp for getting to language school in Xela and on the back end of my trip for traveling around the eastern part of the county. She provided all of my ground transportation, delicious meals, and stored my luggage when I took a week-long backpack excursion. One of my favorite parts of my stay was sitting with her and her beautiful family to enjoy movie night, complete with popcorn.  I would absolutely stay here again."
50,"My fiance and I stayed with Gilda, the owner of Casa de Familia, for (5) days before we began our work at the American School of Guatemala.  Gilda was recommended by a family friend who also had a wonderful experience.  From the very beginning we were treated like family.  Gilda made a Skype appointment with us to find out a little about ourselves and to see if we needed any special accommodations.  The day we landed Gilda greeted us at the airport and drove us back to her B&B.  Once we arrived she showed us to our room which was exactly what we were looking for.  It was a good size, private bathroom, with cable and wifi.  Our introduction to Guatemala was perfect thanks to Gilda.  Over the next (5) days Gilda drove us around Guatemala City, took us to museums and even arranged"
50,"Casa de Familia is a fabulous family owned and operated Bed and Breakfast just outside Guatemala City. The owner Gilda (pronounced Hilda) is fluent in both English and Spanish and is an invaluable resource for all things Guatemalan.   I spent several days with Gilda and her family and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The house was clean, quiet, warm and inviting. It is in an ideal location such that you can get into the city easily, you are close to central shopping centers but also that you are isolated from the noise and bustle of actual city life. There was free fast Wifi, a well maintained garden and a BBQ. For breakfast tasty typical Guatemalan dishes were served each morning.   The best part about my stay wasn't the amenities though, it was Gilda and her"
50,"The location is amazing; almost everything is at walking distance. Fontella Plaza, The Zoo, shopping centers (malls) ETC..... The price is extremely cheap compared to the major hotels chain near the area. Great services  and the friendliness of the staff. The housekeepers are very friendlys...so happy to have customers staying at this hotel. I RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR ANY FOREIGN."
20,"We were in a jam since everything else in the zona viva was full. So were thankful we could get a room at this place. BUT we checked out the very next morning and went elsewhere after the bottom of my daughters feet were jet black after walking around on the carpets for ten minutes AND the hot water in the shower lasted less than three minutes. Service was very nice, although they told us they would need to charge us for an additional person in order to bring us a sheet for my daughter to sleep on the couch, and they charged us for each bottle of water....none is on the house.  One positive is that the kitchen is well appointed, and the suites are spacious."
10,"I had a reservation for 4 nights.  I checked in around 6 PM and checked out the following morning at 5 AM.  Hotel was sold out so they placed me in an office or closet that had been poorly converted into a ""guest"" room.  The room was across from the lobby elevator, without a window that would open and no ventilation whatsoevery.  Finally at 1 am, up due to the noice from the lobby and elevator as well as no air in the room, I started looking online for rooms and find a room that was actually $4 more expensive per night, at a hotel (Conquistador) that was $100 better.  I spoke with the staff and they didn't care.  They would only say that they were sold out.  I understand they were sold out but then they sould not sell a room, instead of placing people in a closet.  I have not"
40,"Spaceous rooms. Helpful personnel who even brought us bottle of rum from secret shop in the middle of night (3 times more expensive, but what do you expect on Christmas?:)) Room and beds had strong smell of dust."
50,"You can not beat the SUITES REFORMA as the best value in the ZONA VIVA if not in the entire country of Guatemala.  Get a good price online with a free breakfast and free computer and biz center, with a weight room and sauna free and a nice free breakast up until 11 am each day AND a shuttle to and from the airport.   The staff are warm and friendly and the service is great.  They actually honor the do not disturb signs and come and clean your room almost immediately when you put that sign on the door and for Latin America that is noteworthy.  The BILL was exactly what I was promised online and not a dime more which is also so typical here.  Padding is rampant but not here.  The on site restaurant has a nice view of the Avenida Reforma and good food at very fair for the Zona"
50,"My wife and I and my parents absolutely loved our stay at hostel Villa Toscana. Exceeded our highest expectations! It was a beautiful and quaint boutique style hotel that spared no loss of attention to every little detail. We arrived later at night and was greeted by very warm welcoming staff that helped us order food and get settled in. In the morning we were treated by a wonderful breakfast that was included and we were waited on for everything like in a restaurant. We truly felt spoiled and well taken care of. The taxi transportation was also taken care of for us making it very easy and stress-free getting to the airport, which is 1-2 minutes away. We would highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again when we return. Thanks again hostal Villa Toscana!"
40,"This pleasant establishment is as close to the airport as it is possible to get.  It is a good place to stay if you want to be close to the airport and not worry about the traffic.   My expert tour guide tells me that he has had 40 minute traffic delays coming in from hotels only a mile away.  It is located in a securely gated area.   There is nothing else very close to this place, so make sure you have made your plans for dinner and other stuff before hand.  The room is comfortable, nothing spectacular or awful except the internet was pathetically slow.   We did run out of hot water, so be warned."
50,"I guess one can't choose the other guests in a hotel, but it was irritating to have to listen to late night strategy sessions for converting the unsuspecting Guatemalans. The hotel itself was excellent, with a nice room, good TV, and an excellent breakfast. Interestingly, the hotel is in a gated community, so they prefer to send out for food rather than have their guests coming and going -- and perhaps being victimized by crime. No matter, they had an excellent selection of menu choices which were reasonably priced, including Chinese, pizza, and other options."
50,"Our group of four spent one night at Villa Toscana before catching a very early flight the following morning. The rooms are clean, small and safe. The do provide soap, shampoo etc and snacks are available in the reception area. The best part of our stay was Nelson. Nelson checked us in, helped with luggage, arranged for a reliable early morning (4:30) taxi and answered every question we asked. Above all...he seemed to really care about providing a great level of service. This is NOT a luxury property, but because of Nelson, we would gladly return. Thank you, Nelson!"
40,"We (party of 4) stayed here one night after returning in an evening flight from FRS (Tikal) and had to have an early start the next day (catch a bus to Xela). Chose this location following advice on the forum and seems the place gets lots of recommendations, particularly if you have a flight to catch the next day. Overall a good stay - clean rooms with dedicated bathroom outside, comfortable beds, quiet (despite being close to the airport). We got here on our own since they offered shuttle service is limited to a party of three and we didn't want to split into two trips which the hotel offered. Staff is friendly and tried to get us info on buses the next day as well as attempted to arrange private transport (which was above our budget) and arranged a cab to take us to the bus"
50,"I loved the hotel, the lobby has marble floors and lots of wood decorations. If I have to go back I will definitely go back to this hotel. Front desk attendant was really nice and helpful. It is located in zona 1, very centric location."
30,"This is an old hotel in quite a shabby part of town. Understandably it's a poor country but the hotel is trying hard. Staff were helpful, polite and all you could wish for when you can't speak their language. The place was clean, our room looked as it had been recently painted, however the color schemes are remarkably dated. The place must have been amazing in the past. I wish this hotel nothing but good luck and hope they continue to improve. We only stayed one night, the complimentary drinks on arrival were an unexpected plus, breakfast was great as it was included and the free shuttle to the airport the added bonus. I suggest people do not knock this hotel because it does not match up to places they have stayed elsewhere as having seen the surroundings they have done well to"
50,Our room for two nights was spotlessly clean!  The hotel staff were so helpful and one nice young lady spoke English.  The FULL free breakfast each morning was delicious!  A complimentary cocktail with appetizer was provided for us on our first night.  There are MANY great restaurants nearby that can be reached by walking down the pedestrian only street in front of the hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel to travelers coming to this city.
30,"It's a bit like stepping back in time when you come here, but that's not necessarily such a bad thing. It's in a great location, right in the heart of the city, walking distance to all the sights, plus they have a free shuttle bus that will pick you up and return you to the airport, all very positive things. However, the property is old and tired. Check in took forever. I don't know what the problem was with the two people ahead of me, but it took 45 minutes to check them in, while several hotel staff in suits just wandered around the lobby doing nothing. They could have helped out the sole check in clerk. Check out was also painful. A security guard had to go and check the room - Lord knows why, there is NOTHING to take - and she couldn't have been in less of a hurry had she"
40,"We were staying at a nasty hotel a few blocks away and moved to Hotel Royal Palace. It was such a relief to get a room here from the previous hotel. It's new and modern with great decor. Rooms are spacious and we had a nice balcony. The location is absolutely perfect. There's tons to do right when you step outside including a theatre, blocks and blocks of restaurants and shops, street vendors, markets ect.  Staff is great, fast check in, no deposit required, clean big bathroom and furniture. And we got 1 complimentary drink at the bar each. We would stay again. "
40,"This Bed and Breakfast was amazing, the owners and the couple running it were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfasts they make and serve were authentic Guatemalan food, very accommodating to vegetarian and vegans.  Though we didn't realize at the time of booking that it is a ""get in, get out"" location, very close to the airport (within walking distance if you are brave) and great if you aren't planning to stay long. Though we nicknamed it the ""compound"" as you are gated in and told it isn't safe for us to be out after the sun goes down."
20,"This place was clean, had hot water, was close to the airport and included transfer. Unfortunately the woman tried to charge us way too much, far more than the price we'd agreed on the phone, and put us in a lesser room than we were charged for. We sorted it out and got our money back and an 'upgrade' but it left a bitter taste. Probably wouldn't go back there. Also worth noting that apart from the airport there are no restaurants so nowhere to eat nearby.  "
40,"A great place ! Close to the airport....provided a safe reliable taxi for my airplane arrival (he was on time..even a bit early).....stayed in the dorm. Clean and quiet. Breakfast was very good and lots of food . All of the staff was very friendly and greeted me and gave me a lift back to the airport. Highly recommended !!!!! I didnt spend much time hanging out here but was a good stop over, safe place to sleep and eat on the way to other journeys."
20,"The hostal it self is nice, safe, clean and well maintained. The stuff are nice as well. The owners are not completely honest. When we wanted to switch rooms they lied that the other rooms are full and when we wanted to stay one more night they said the hostal is full which it wasn't."
50,"Delightful! The entire experience! Safe, clean, comfortable. Very good breakfast. The owners were so kind & helpful. They bent over backwards to insure we had the best possible stay. I will come back again. I hope it is soon!"
40,"I have not stayed at tne Pension Mesa in a couple years, but I have been a regular visitor there for nearly three decades and I love the place. There are about two dozen rooms arranged around two internal courtyards in a centuries-old building. To either side are a restaurant and a bar with service ports through the walls (which are thick enough to repel cannon balls). You never really need to leave. It is near the corner of 10th avenue and 10th street in Zone 2, and the Zone qualifier is an important one since there are about 17 different 10th & 10th intersections in Guat. City. Private rooms were about US$1.50 the last time i was there. Bathrooms are down the hall. Hot showers are available. The hotel owners have in the past picked me up at the airport on my arrival. Bad"
50,"Great atmosphere, very friendly staff, very clean and nice place to stay. Great location and really near from the airport. I definitely recommend it and if I come back to Guatemala I would definitely stay again here.  - Saludos desde Mexico ☺️"
40,"I was only able to stay there for 1 night, but the staff was super friendly and helpful. They directed me to a good ATM, and one of the guys helped me get to the buses instead of having to pay for a shuttle. They do have a pool that looked nice, and I'm sure it's a fun place to stay, but the safety factor is huge. Very secure."
40,"This is a fairly good backpacker's hostel in a surprisingly upscale part of Guatemala City (lots of fancy restaurants nearby; I'd recommend Casa de Saúl for great brunch which is not at all pricy by US standards).  Cleanliness was fine for me, about what I expect from an average hostel. The private room we stayed in the first night was claustrophobic, and the room we stayed in the second night was better but weirdly located (with a big window facing a pool that nobody seemed to use). The beds were comfy."
50,"We stayed here for two nights before heading down to Antigua and loved our stay! The dorm room we stayed in was really nice, they way they have designed and laid out the room is just what backpackers need. We really liked the light and plug points in each bed set up and our dorm with the sliding door out to the pool was really cool! Also the rooftop was nice to relax and meet other guests on."
50,"Very cute decor, newly renovated and close to everything in zone 10 (walking distance to food and night life). From the airport take a taxi not a private car and it is 70Q. The staff are helpful and the water pressure is great. Hot water showers too. They also have Netflix and good internet. Stayed here 3x during my travels through Guatemala. Also Uber is much cheaper to and from the airport if you have it. "
50,"What a lovely small hotel! Their customer service is superb and the front desk  remembered me from three years ago! The room was charming, the bed comfortable, the towels fluffy and the shower was hot! The outdoor breakfast area was beautiful and the whole hotel had interesting design details. And of course it was immaculately clean. As a solo older woman, this will be my “go to” place to stay in Guatemala City."
50,"This Boutique hotel is well located, just a 10 minute walk to the Oakland Shopping Mall. The hotel is well decorated, from the reception to the breakfast area to the rooms. The receptionist provided us with above and beyond service. Kudos to Fernanda (I think that was her name). Since we arrived early and it wasn't time to check-in and also that we were leaving the next day at 3 a.m. the receptionist offered us breakfast since it was included and we were going to miss it the next day. We thought that was way above than what we expected. She arranged for a taxi for the next day, too. When we returned later to check-in, out baggage was already in the room. They really know what hospitality is all about. Thank you."
50,"I flew in to Guatemala City at 4 in the morning and was thinking I would just be able to store my bags for when my room was ready later that night. I was so happy to find I was able to check right in take a nap! Obviously, that wouldn't have been possible if the hotel was fully booked, but I'm so greatful for it. My room was top notch, quiet and comfortable. There was a nice outdoor breakfast behind the hotel as well as a small cafe next door. The hotel is located near tons of other restaurants and hotels in a neighborhood that's very safe. The staff were friendly, and I highly recommend this little hotel."
20,"Hotel was pretty well located for what we needed, a short layover whilst in transit with some near by restaurants, the mall etc   The room finished nicely and staff helpful whilst we were there. The breakfast was just ok.  We later noticed some additional charges to our card that had been processed a month after check out nearly. The hotel is yet to provide an explanation for the charges or a refund. They’ve now stopped replying to all emails too. I’ve escalated it to MasterCard but if this hasn’t put you off I’d at least check your statements. "
40,"A small beautiful hotel a few steps away from Fontabella mall. We stayed 1 night and felt we had a good experience staying there. Room was a good size, its bed comfy. Overall Room was lovely and services excellent. Highly recommended."
40,"We stayed at this hostel for 2 nights and we would stay there again. The building is old, but the rooms are nice, they have hot showers and free purified water for guests. The owner is supernice, hospitable and helpfull, the sweetest person you'll ever meet :) You get free breakfast, there is a fully equiped kitchen and everything is clean. Just make sure not to use the taxiservice (not an official taxi) they offer cause it is waaay overpriced !"
10,"We stayed in this hostel two nights and we were more then happy to get out of there...  Staff is very friendly and helpful, but that is it!   Breakfast is very simple - orange juice, bread and jam. First morning we found nicely prepared breakfast table. The staff even made photo from us eating at table. Next morning we were from 8 - 10 milling around, but there was nothing! Not. Even coffee! Kitchen is really dirty....  Equipment is less than minimalistic! Dorms are very small, bed ventilated and a beds not to comfortable. In general this hostel need quite big renovation, before they can ask price which they are asking now."
30,"Friendly staff, eventhough the dorm wasnt fancy and nice, it's just ok. The reason I stay here is because I had a friend who was staying there and he recommended me. The bathroom weren't clean and it located in guatemala city downtown, it's not safe to go out after 6pm."
10,"I've stayed one night at this hostel with my brother, and it was enough to realize the waste of money that we did. The place is a mess, with dirty dorms and bad location (Guatemala City downtown), making it hard to feel safe at night if you need to eat something after your check-in, since Gerona hasn't any snacks to sell. I'd avoid this place."
10,"Admittedly the staff is really warm-hearted and friendly, be careful!!! It's all surface mask!!! My friend, Lichee lost 300 dollars and a souvenir doll; I lost my precious Ethiopian scarf given by an equally precious friend, and a newly bought Guatemala bag!!! Other references include losing credit card and money was found to have been lost!!! Even the area is one of the most dangerous parts in the City. For your security, PLEASE PLEASE don't choose this one!!! I don't know why it only got positive references, perhaps some racist just hates Asians! Sleeping on the street is even better: at least you know who might take your life, without regretting having showed your stupid trust and affection!!! My worst worst experience ever!!! Even only one couch host just stole a"
10,I have stayed at this location many times as I travel to Guatemala often for charity work. I had a last minute trip and I arranged the hotel shuttle to pick me up at the airport at 9:00 pm. I arrived with 9 bags of donated medical supplies and guess what NO SHUTTLE. I looked for about 30 minutes then found someone to call the Courtyard. They said they would send the shuttle right away. Well almost 2 hours later somebody arrived in a car to pick me and 9 bags. I was furious. I crammed all bags into the car and had 1 in my lap. When I finally got to the hotel the response from the front desk was sorry. that's it. No explanation of what happened or anything. I asked to speak with the manager and he said he would look into it and let me know. 2 days later still nothing. I messaged
40,"First to point out is that the hotel is fairly close to the airport and provides free shuttle service. This is important once you spend time sitting in GC traffic!  This facility is beautiful. It's rather large for a Courtyard, and the lobby is immense. The rooms are spacious. I passed on the restaurant for breakfast, but the fruit was fresh and the cooked food great. the hotel has a small workout area and an extremely friendly staff!  Unfortunately, I did not get to walk around the area since it was presidential inauguration day and there were military and police officers everywhere.  I would definitely recommend this property if you have business in the area."
50,"I was extremely impressed wit the Courtyard Marriott in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The hotel is super new and very upscale, service is very good and the food is very good. The rooms are very quaint, spacious, fresh and modern."
10,Upon checking in we were told that breakfast was included with our reservation.  Great.  We could get up have a little breakfast easily and head to airport.  Next morning we were helping ourselves to the buffet and we were presented with a bill.  Neither the food manager nor the front desk cared what we had been told upon check in.  Simply bad customer service.  An unfortunate ending to our 10 days in Guatemala.
40,"We had to take it as one emergency night at this hotel, and it was really neat and modern, in the end we had so restfull night and a wonderfull breakfast at the restuurant. The service personal its very helpfull"
50,Amazing family! They tried you like a family member. If you are arriving at the airport just text them and they will pick you up. It's much cheaper and you can be 100 % sure that it's safe!! Really clean and perfect located.
50,"Amazing staying and amazing atmosphere! Thank you for everything!  They were very kind and disponible, as soon as i understood i couldnt pay with my credit card (they only accept cash, i guess its written somewhere) they took me with the car to the closest ATM because i was afraid to move alone in the evening, they shew me around and took me where i could buy some food, they let me used their printer to print the ticket of the airplane and, at last, they took me in the middle of the night to the airport (this costed me 70 q). They were really really nice and made me feel at home! The room was fine (i booked a matrimonial room just for me), everything was really cleaned up. The only ""negative point"" was the wifi that didnt arrive to my room. Anyway, an amazing staying that i will"
50,"We were lucky we stayed there. And first of all - muchas gracias, Magdalena. We had some problems and she did all the best not only to make our stay very pleasant ( It was ), but to solve those problems too. Property itself is perfect for a stay before/after flight. Good breakfast, transfer from/to airport. Comfortable beds, spacious rooms, home atmosphere. In addition to it - lovely yard, relaxing place for morning coffee or  evening vine."
50,"After a long bus ride this was a lovely sanctuary in busy Guatemala City. The Spanish-feel hotel is like a large bed-and- breakfast; speaking of which the breakfast was five-star! The rooms have high-ceilings and comfy beds. All is clean as can be.   The downstairs has a pleasant common area,  a dining room and walled garden with a sitting area.   The host speaks English as does her husband.   We arrived by Uber, went out to dinner, on her good recommendation, with Uber and were taken free to the nearby airport for free. (We of course paid for the first two rides. This is my first experience with Uber anywhere and the drivers both spoke English and the drivers and cars were first class.)   This is a nice little hotel, close to the airport without being very noisy, in a gated"
50,Friendly and nice little place near the airport. Got picked up at the airport and then they helped me get to a shuttle to Antigua the day after.  It's clean and the beds are comfortable. Will stay here again! 
40,"Great place if you're doing a night in the city before or after a flight. They offer free pickups and dropoffs to the airport.  Very clean. Simple rooms with only a bed and wardrobe. Shared bathroom. Q135 a night for one person. The owners are very friendly and helpful. A simple breakfast is served between 7 and 9 am. I got two huge pancakes and a nice slice of cantaloupe, plus coffee. There is a small sitting area with a TV, books, games, and a computer you can use for free. Free WiFi as well.  There is nothing nearby so if you're looking for a restaurant, you either have to get a taxi to go there, or order by phone for delivery.  It is a gated community, so it's very safe.  The sound of the planes landing and taking off was not that loud considering how close the house is to"
40,"We arrived here late in the evening and just wanted a place to stay the night and then leave for Antigua the next morning. The owner picked us up from the airport and drove us the short way to the B&B. Owners are very friendly. The rooms are clean and simple. The shared bathroom looks quite nice and even offers warm water. Breakfast had the standard fruit and toast ""continental"" breakfast. I can recommend this place if you're looking for an easy to get to place to stay the night. Because of the vicinity to the airport you can hear the planes. "
50,"Everything from booking, setting up my pickup from the airport, check-in, WiFi connection, hot shower, paying and checking out was smooth and simple.   Super nice family. Staff has great English skills.  If you are a light sleeper it might not be the best choice because it is so close to the airport. "
50,I stayed here for one night. Great choice. Well located close to the airport but not too noisy. Nice hosts who provided me with hot and cold water for drinks and kitchenware. There is also a microwave for use and good WiFi. In the secure and safe area outside are well stocked stores. The bedroom was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was also clean. A 5AM transport to the airport was included in the price. Very happy.
50,"We had such a lovely time at Mi Casa, Tu Casa. The family home is so nice and welcoming and we stayed in a room that is in a separate little house in the garden. The was super private and very cosy. Everything was extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and we had everything we needed. The owner was so kind and welcoming, and we also had breakfast here one of the days - he’s a good cook, so highly recommend. It was plentiful with granola, fruits, yoghurt, fresh juice, scrambled egg, bread, beans and plantain.   The pick up from the airport also worked really well, and it’s in a perfect location for a quick stopover. "
40,"We spent one night after very long flight to Guatemala. The ""hotel"" - family house - was exactly what we needed. Very quiet, except noise from 2-3 airplanes, maybe just 150 meters above the roof, landing in the night. Nice yard, clean and comfortable rooms. Very good breakfast."
40,"I usually book this for the night before we fly out in the morning it is very close to the airport.  I prefer the downstairs ""Garden room"" bum leg bad knee. Mynor generally takes us to the sirport in the morning I think it is 50Q the room is generally around 220Q  Across the street next door to Marians Petit inside the little store ask about dinner. Mario is a chef, I still dream of his strawberry flan.  Meals are what he is making (the choice?) and include everything including your drink unless you want beer I think that may have been an extra 5Q.  The side opens and there is a table for dining GREAT FOOD. Great company as well."
50,"We had planned on staying at Mi Casa, Tu Casa on the last night of our trip, but ended up pushing our plans around and took the overnight bus to Guatemala City.  However, the owner of Mi Casa, Tu Casa was still kind enough to wake up very early for me and let me stay in the room from 6 am until noon!    On top of that, those few hours were the best hours of sleep on my trip!  The room is in the back guesthouse with a bathroom all to the guest; it's impeccably clean, totally quiet, and the bed is unbelievably comfortable.  After my morning of sleep, I was even provided a free ride to the airport, which is very close by.  I wish we could have stayed more nights!"
40,"We needed somewhere that we could put our heads down for a night before an early flight the next day. The owner picked us up and made sure our taxi turned up the next day (even though we left at 5am!). The room was huge, the bed comfortable and the bathroom clean with hot water. No complaints at all. "
50,"The online images do not do justice to this hotel. It has a playground for kids,  a small business center, swimming pool with hot tub and a laundry room for longer stays. Breakfast is complimentary which features local cuisine. There are many restaurants within walking distance along with a few retail stores. I say yes to this place."
50,"The online pictures do not do justice to this hotel. It caters to business travelers and people just on vacation. The hotel has a playground, swimming pool, business center and laundry room for those who stay longer. I am staying in the two bedroom apartment which is beautifully fitted. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and there are several restaurants within walking distance from the hotel."
50,"We stayed here when we first came to Guatemala to look for a house.  Very friendly and homey.  Well located, safe.  Great for families.  We send visitors here often as it is close to the office.  Full kitchen.  There is a nice bar across the street and a mediocre US chain restaurant next door (Chilies).   10 of Guatemala Cities best restaurants within walking distance.   Pretty safe, but don't take your phone out in the street or carry anything you are not willing to part with quickly.  I have never had a problem, but it does happen."
50,"My fiance and I stayed there a week for business reasons and we were nicely surprised by the good manners of all the hotel employees. One day we slept late and wake up very hungry after the breakfast hour; we arrived to the restaurant and asked if they had anything to eat and two employees served us quickly and kindly a more than complete breakfast.  The neighborhood is probably the nicest and safest in Guatemala City, it is located at Zona 10. Several good restaurants at walk distance.  The hotel facilities are clean, nice and very natural. Nice gardens and pools, and stone everywhere.  We will keep going back there when we need to return to Guatemala City."
40,I stayed here for four nights when I traveled to Guatemala City on business. The staff were very friendly and the accommodations were nice. Breakfast was typical Latin American fare and was tasty enough. The restaurant is only open for breakfast although there are plenty of other places for lunch or dinner within walking distance. You can have the hotel order a few items for you from Chili's next door and have them delivered to your room.   The pool was a little small and I don't think it sees much use.   Overall this was a nice hotel. I would recommend it for either long or short term stays. 
50,"The lack of quality restaurants and gym facilities keeps this hotel from being a five star in my opinion.   However one of the best sleep I have ever had a a hotel. Reception staff is extremely helpful also approachable. Location of Barcelo is convenient to airport, many great restaurants and shopping malls. Can compete with any top hotel in the Americas and Europe.. "
50,"Comfortable rooms, everything works (usually in big hotels you find something wrong in your room). Great and stable internet connection.. Delicious breakfast buffet... from continental to Guatemalan type "
50,we stayed there because the person traveling with us had a 7 am flight and we were coming from Palin at night. We found the hotel so comfortable that we stayed there the night before our flight which wasn't until the afternoon. We were coming from Antigua and had heard the traffic can be terrible. This way we had no anxiety about our flight and enjoyed the great service.
30,"We have been coming to the Barcelo for years as a family... Unfortunately they recently changed their rules so that children under 18 cannot use the hot tub, which really changes the usability of the pool area over the course of a stay, especially in the evenings when it gets chilly.  The Tikal Futura, which has always been our other, equivalent, choice, allows children to use the hot tub under the supervision of an adult... and the pool area is covered in case of rain etc... So I guess that will be our future choice for family stays 😕"
50,"Very convenient, very comfortable. Excellent breakfast buffet.  Super comfy beds. Clean and welcoming. Free shuttle collection service from the airport was very efficient and made my arrival in Guatemala for the first time stress free and easy."
30,Stayed here one night in March 2016.  The room was adequate and quite honestly I was exhausted from traveling so I went to sleep quickly.  I would not recommend going out at night or after dark.  The hotel had an armed guard outside the door.  I don't know about location as we were in and out within 10 hours.  Adequate to lay my head for a night.
30,"Man oh man, I have pretty mixed reviews about this place. I stayed here twice.  First impressions: I had to call them on the phone to let them know my flight arrived, since they never responded to my email about confirmation of pick up at the airport. The front desk guy didn't even greet me. He basically just asked what I wanted. So I checked in and was given a remote control for the TV with my key. Plus he didn't tell me anything about the hotel or breakfast hours or give me my breakfast vouchers. I had to ask for all that later on. Oh, and they charge six dollars to use their crappy computer for Internet!  The first room was minimally okay. It was in the ¨quiet¨section so it faced a wall of another building with about one foot distance between the two. Very dark inside. There"
30,"The hotel was nice, but nothing special. The check-in (and out) was very fast and efficient. Personnel was friendly and most of them spoke English.  The breakfast was not as good as we have used to have in hotels (not buffet), but still quite good. Free transportation to airport was nice service."
40,Good service. Fast check in. Free shuttle. Location in center of Guatemala City. Close to restaurants and bar. Actually they have his own restaurante and coffee shop.  The smoking room smell terrible...
30,"This hotel is ok. It's a bit expensive relative to other, nicer hotels in Guatemala City. The hallways and rooms are dark, but pretty clean. It's not a bad place to stay the night before or after a flight, but if you're going to stay multiple nights in the city, there are similarly priced hotels that are much nicer. "
10,"I called from the airport on the morning of November 30th with an urgency for a room! I am currently on a trip with 8 other people and we all needed a hotel urgently because of a cancellation at another hotel. I called and the lady who answered couldn't even say ""I don't speak English"", after a couple of minutes I was transferred to the ""manager"" or at least that's what I asked for. He could barely speak English and was of poor help. I didn't have an internet connection at that time and was wasting the couple of Guatemalan coins I had on me on a public telephone, I eventually ran out of coins and had to spend another half hour searching for another hotel to go to.  I had never experienced a hotel in Guatemala that didn't offer an English speaking front-desk or manager for that"
40,"It's a good hotel if your going in a business plan. The rooms are very nice and clean. The only thing the hotel needs to improve is to include the breakfast in the rate of the room because actually doesn't count with a restaurant in the hotel (There is one restaurante in one side of the hotel) If your going on a tourism plan I'm not sure if is the best option because in the night is not safe to walk in the area and is far from ""Zona Rosa"" of Guatemala City (about 25 minutes walking)"
50,"From check in to check out. The staff was amazing. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I wanted to take the pillows home with me. The front desk was bilingual and helped me with a lot of planning and activities. My husband enjoyed the breakfast, but due to my diet I was limited in what I could eat. The gym has only cardio equipment, but I was told that you can go to the attached Westin and use their facilities gym for $10. Overall I definitely would recommend them. "
20,"Poor service, we requested help to pick up our luggage (6 pieces) from third floor,  we waited for 20 minutes, they never came so we did that ourselves, when we got to 1st floor they saw us with the luggage and until then we were offered assistance."
50,"Loved this hotel.  It is very nice, the staff is great and very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is connected to the Westin, which makes it great.  The neighbourhood is great.  I travelled for business but also went with my baby and my wife.  Had a great time.  Breakfast is very good. Highly recommended!"
40,Likes:  service was good. Very good breakfast buffet. Seems oriented to longer says — like business travelers. Connected to Westrin. Dislike: Hotel cleaning staff was noisy in the mornings. Made it hard to sleep late.
50,"Hotel room was perfect for our needs, location was great by the airport and near plenty of food options. Just a note friends who stayed on the other side of us had noise from wedding parties but we didn’t have any noise. Most things are walkable or you can Uber as needed. "
20,"I was on the 6th floor... And just couldn't sleep. The hotel is on Reforma, which is a lovely and centric avenue in the trendy 10th section, that's where restaurants, discos, hotels, etc are..  But the buses in Guatemala loooove to hunk their horns, their brakes are not to good, judging by the noice they make; and to resume it all they are noice polluters. You just hear everything!. The room( can't call it suite.. no space!) is out dated. old TV, small, old furniture, dark, etc. The breakfast was very good, and the staff very helpfull and prosessional."
30,"I so appreciate the staff, location and delicious breakfasts.  But my suite was very tired.  The carpet was dusty, the bed mattress too old.  It is right on Reforma and therefore very noisy.   Its only an average hotel, but they are trying!"
50,"We had a passport ""mishap"" in November and had to stay 4 extra days in the capital until we got emergency passports issued and could get a flight back to the US. We wanted a place close to the embassy, so the very helpful agent at American Airlines recommended Suites Reforma.  First of all, the service: the guys at the front desk were all extremely friendly and helpful, and actually gave us a discount upon learning of our situation. The room was clean, decent sized, and had a small refrigerator. You get a good breakfast on the house every morning. There's a small work-out room with weights, and a computer room with 3 or 4 computers and free internet--which came in very handy.  Location--couldn't be better. We usually stay in Zone 1 at the Pan American, but since we needed to be"
40,"I worked in Guatemala City during 2010 and my experience at this hotel was overall good.  I got a nice one bedroom apartment with two double beds, nice closet, dresser, TV, bathroom, living room with one more TV, dining room and kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, blender, coffee brewer, pots, pans and dishware.  I had a very nice view of the Volcán de Agua. It included, shuttle to and from the airport, breakfast and internet service.  It has a very good location at Zona 10 where you can find excellent restaurants and is very close (walking distance) to 3 very nice malls. (Fontabella Plaza is beautiful).  Staff was very nice and helpful and I have a very fond memory of all of them.  Since its located right on Avenida Reforma, it is a strategic place for easy transportation and"
50,"My sisters and I stayed here from mid-Jan to early April while one of my sisters underwent cancer treatment.  This was a difficult time for us as my sister passed away at the end of March. The staff was amazing, compassionate, and supportive.  The room met our needs perfectly.  There is free wifi, which is a real money-saver.  Breakfast for two is included.  It is close to the US Embassy, in a very safe part of the city.  If we return to Guatemala City, I will definitely come back and stay here."
50,This was a fantastic find recommended to us by a Guatemalan friend. The facility is recently remodeled. The rooms and public areas are beautiful. The beds are comfortable and rooms & bathrooms are clean & up to date. There is a free shuttle to the airport which is only a 5 minute trip. There is a complimentary breakfast which can be enjoyed in covered area with tables next to the beautiful garden area with a fountain providing background sounds. If a guest has an early flight a bagged breakfast will be provided. If there is any drawback to this hotel it is that is difficult to find.  It is within a gated compound & there is no outside signage. The GPS will lead to the entrance to the compound but to the unknowing traveler it seems that one is being led to a gated dead end.  Be
50,"I chose this bed and breakfast because it was recommended by my language school. I found it to be very safe, clean, quiet, and accommodating. The bedrooms were basic, with a shared bathroom in the hallway. The bathroom and shower were very clean. The food was excellent. The management was very professional and accommodating. I will stay there again this summer in July."
30,"Late evening arrival. Shuttle cost is inappropriate. I complained bitterly to the poor guy at the reception desk, but after all it was his boss who was bad not the worker. They knew I was coming but did not come to get me. Took several phone calls. Rooms was small, clean, comfortable. Had hot shower. The worker was nice, and he gave me some juice & snack when I left at 4am. Did not see the place during the day."
40,"It's a tranquilo place, in a safe (gated) area. We ahd a room with a balcony and view to the volcano. Very friendly staff at breakfast. Good breakfast. The place is a tad tacky for my taste, a bit more than I expected from the photos. But it was all good. OK clean. Beds were more comfortable then in any other place on this trip (but the rest was really bad)."
40,"Good place to stay  overnight  if your flight  is early  in the morning. Clean room and plenty  of hot water. If other guests are  loud, you will hear all. My booking stated that I could  pay  in Quetzales or in US dollars. I paid in US dollars, but the staff could not give  me my change  in dollars , only  in quetzales. What  is the use of quetzales when you are   leaving Guatemala? Although the amount was small, as a principle, if you accept payment  in one currency, make sure you can provide change  in that currency."
10,Unacceptable behavior!!! They just cancelled our reservation and left us at Guatemala City by night two girls just trying to find a hotel to stay.  They do not speak English at all and they can't do anything .... I am just wondering why do we paid 53$!!!!
20,"We stayed here as a group. If I had a choice, I would not stay here again. First off, the hotel lobby is impressive and inviting. There was a small band there playing music when we arrived, however, once we arrived, they tried to change the rate to almost double. Our rooms were awful. There was absolutely no ventilation such as a ceiling fan or air conditioning. There was a cockroach the size of a small turtle on our floor still alive but on its back flailing around. The shower head was malfunctioning and water squirted out the top of it. The sink leaked leaving a huge water puddle on the floor causing slippery conditions. There is a transom window in each bathroom that is left open so you can hear people walking and talking in the hallways as you are using the bathroom. (Wonder"
40,"It's back to the 4th floor of the classic Royal Palace in Zona 1 for the fourth time. This time,#409 a corner room, is huge and has something relatively rare in moderately-priced accommodations here-- a King sized bed. Most hotels in this range we've stayed have two double beds and that is also available. Royal Palace is located right on La Sexta. On a Sunday the promenade of families, couples, entertainers and hawkers starts about 10 am and doesn't let up until after sundown. It is a great people watching location. it is also around the block from Restaurante Altuna, a favorite dining experience. While. we've noticed some changes, small upgrades, the general state of repair needs some attention. it is after all one of the once elegant landmarks in the neighborhood."
10,"From 1999-2005, I used to stay at the Royal Palace all the time when it was managed by Best Western. My wife and I returned there right before Christmas and we were incredibly disappointed.  No longer associated with Best Western, the hotel is now shabby, grungy  and the hotel staff indifferent.  The room was dark (there was only one incandescent light bulb hanging from a wire from the ceiling, the beds were old and the linens/comforters had many stains. You could see right through the thin white sheet to a stained mattress underneath. Yuck!  Also, the bath towels were very old with tattered edges.  They looked more like mop/floor towels than bath towels. There was lots of mildew in the shower too. My wife, who is from Guatemala, and used to a variety of hotels, said we are"
30,"The Royal Palace and Pan American were among the few hotels that survived the extended period during which Zona 1 was down at the heels and dangerous. The fact is that it is for us the place to stay in the Historic District. Located right on La Sexta, it is also a great location for strolling with the thousands of locals who are loving this pedestrian mall. This was our second stay at the Royal Palace . We had a junior suite with king size bed,desk convertible sofa, ample storage, and a large balcony. The restaurant is adequate and there are many other good choices nearby."
50,"It is a really well-equipped hostel with nice facilities and cool staff. I came through on my way to the airport and had a great time. Every bunk has its own power-plugs and light and you can put up something like a curtain if you want to. Everything was very clean, the garden with the pool is simply gorgeous and the staff makes sure, you check out the best spots in the city if you have time for it.  Would definitely recommend :)"
50,"We arrived in Guatemala City at night time and went to the hostel (located in zona 10) by taxi (taxi blanco as advised). On the way there we did notice quite some ppl hanging around on street corners; my advice would be not to walk it there from the airport.   However, once nearing the hostel, we noticed it was in a fine area with a proper gate. The receptionist was helpful and late check in was no problem; neither was the early check out. We stayed in a 8 bedroom mixed dorm. Beds were made. Shower was clean and warm.   If i ever travel through Guatemala city again and am in need for a cheap place to crash, this will be my go-to place and therewith my advice to you."
40,I had a private room with view on the pool. Very comfortable and clean as well as common showers. Great value for the price! You can even cook your on food in big kitchen if you want. Very safe neighbourhood Go there
40,"Located in the upscale area of Zona 10. The area is safe and very peaceful about a 10min walk to the centre which houses offices, chain hotels and restaurants.  The hostel is new, the staff were informative and helpful. There is a swimming pool too, great during the summer months. Bathrooms are clean, towels must be rented for a fee. There is a TV room and a good dining room cum kitchenette.   Stayed here in transit coming from  Lake Atitlan and traveling to El Salvador by Pulmantur bus the following morning which leaves from the Holiday Inn hotel about a 10min walk from the hostel so very convenient.  Good wifi and overall a very affordable place. "
40,"It’s a pretty decent hostel, in a great location. But there are problems with the hot water😭😭 If you can’t provide hot water, are you even a hostel? Try Quetzalroo up the road if you want a better guide and a thorough tour of the city. That hostel is brilliant"
50,"Perfect location for the airport, so close you could walk there but your airport transfer is included in the price.  One of the safest areas of Guate and also in a gated community.  Cleanest place I've stayed in during my 4 weeks in Guatemala and I could actually fit on the bed.  The owners are very helpful as well. "
50,"Super clean and close to the airport. I had issues at the airport with needing a transit visa at the last minute, and the owners were lovely and helpful. They also offered to organise dinner delivery. A good choice for first or last night in Guatemala."
50,"After arriving into Guatemala city alone from Ireland, I was happy to be greeted at the airport and brought back to the hostel. The place felt like a home away from home, and the staff were so friendly! Delicious breakfast too.   The hostel rooms were clean, and the hostel was in a compound with a guard so I felt very safe!   Would definitely go back!"
50,"This is the second time our mission group has stayed at Los Lagos. after an exhausting week, we were tired, hungry and ready to go home. It was great to check in with Lolly the night before we flew home, knowing she would have good food, comfortable beds, and relaxing areas for us to hang out in. We will stay again next year."
40,Stayed for one night in a twin room with private bathroom as we were waiting for flights the next day out if guatemala. Very very good location right next to the airport in a gated community. The staff will even give you a ride to the airport!  Room was basic but adequate. Shower and bathroom were clean but we didn't test the shower as we'd had issues elsewhere with dodgy Guatemalan hot water systems.   Only issue with the place is that it's convenient airport location doesn't make it ideal for going out to get dinner or food without taking an expensive cab to guate's main restaurant area. We got Domino's delivered in the end which the lovely owners organized for us!  Breakfast was also included and was good sized and pretty tasty.   I reccomend this place strongly if you've got
30,It's a nice property however rooms are smaller in size as compare to similar rating hotel. Breakfast menu is OK. I have enjoyed my stay during my visit. Staff is nice and polite but they can't help you in some areas . I am rating this hotel 7/10. They do money exchange as well but you will have hard luck to get it done since they do small amounts exchange. I had to chage 40 usd however the lady told me they can do just 15 usd exchange for which you have to pay exact 10 + 5 dollars bills. They even didn't accept the 20usd bill. 
50,"As a lifetime titanium member, I’ve spent literally years staying in Marriotts around the world. This is a good one.   Our room was new or recently remodeled, and nicely done. The mattress is super comfortable. Front desk check in and check out was fast and efficient, and I thank them for honoring our late checkout request. We didn’t eat at the restaurant as we were in GC for a long tourist weekend and had other places we wanted to eat.   The location is great - within easy walking distance to many great restaurants, and for those that aren’t within walking distance, taxis are quick to arrive.   I’ll definitely stay here again if we come back to GC. "
50,"This not the typical Marriott, the lobby is modern, large and yet cozy. Restaurant offers light fare and hearty meals. Bar is fully stocked with friendly bartenders, great selection of wines by the glass. Rooms are spacious, modern and well equipped.  Location is superb for business or pleasure, walking distance from plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops."
50,"A huge upgrade from the standard USA style courtyard property. This hotel is in a mid/high rise building in the heart of z10. Great central location. The hotel is very new and the ammentities are all top notch. Great food, fitness center, and even my favorite local craft beer (Antigua Cerveza!) on tap! Highly recommend."
50,"Excellent hotel, fairly new construction and well located close to Hard Rock Cafe. Rooms and bathrooms are great size and well maintained, modern decoration and pretty good mattress/pillows. The food at the restaurant is more than perfect. The staff is highly professional and very kind. Nothing to complaint for.... I will definitely stay with them again."
50,"I arrived at midnight after having booked the hotel at 9am. Despite the lateness of both my booking and arrival, a man (Rudolpho) was on hand to greet me, and offered me a drink! The internet here is fast, purified water is available, and the kitchen is kept clean. The area seems run down, but is safe. Would stay here again."
50,This hostal is in zone 1 and maybe the area is not the best but using common sense is all good.  I travelled alone (female) and both the owner and the person in charge were attentive to all my needs and gave me all the route and safe tips I needed.  I stayed there for 10 days and will be back in three more weeks and in the summer 2013.
40,"If you have an early flight and want to be near the airport, this is a perfect place to stay.  It's a private suite in the garden just steps from the main house. Everything is clean, up-to-date and in great shape. Wi-Fi is fine, bed is comfortable.  Be aware that you're in a gated community which has some small convenience stores but no restaurants nearby. If you want supper, the owner offers to call for pizza delivery.  This limits the time you wish to stay at this house, since it's far from any other conveniences.  It was perfect for us, at the end of a 3-week trip. Cash only."
50,"We stayed here for one night before an early morning departure. The location is only a 4 minute drive from the airport and the host drove us there for free at 6am, and also helped us order pizza for dinner since it's not safe to go out  Good wifi too!  10/10 "
50,"We booked this hotel for a quick stopover the night before our flight home. We had a great week of adventure in Guatemala, and were coming to Mi Casa, Tu Casa from the beach at El Pardeon.   The location is very convenient to the airport in a gated community. Our driver had a bit of trouble finding it, but the owner actually got in his car and came to find us! The house is beautiful. And our host was warm and so accommodating.   Upon arrival he offered us water immediately, and then helped us get some take-out ordered for dinner. While we were getting settled, he setup a whole dinner setting in his kitchen for us. Then he showed us to the local tienda so we could get snacks for our trip home, and some wine for dinner.   The room was large and comfortable, and the proximity to"
30,"The pictures of the room look great, but the room I booked was actually very small. At least it was clean and the breakfast was good. The location was not so bad as it was close to a mall and some restaurants, but the main attractions I went to see (Tikal and Antígua) would require a car anyway"
50,"We stayed for two nights at the Meraki and found it to be a nice gem in the middle of the large hotels.  The staff was very accommodating when we encountered a mishap with a scheduled tour to Tikal.  They arranged multiple taxis for us to encounter the city center and also transport to the airport.  The breakfast that was included was good and started the mornings off great.  This is a small unique hotel and it appears that each room is different, but was very clean with fresh linens, nice showers, a contemporary design.  We enjoyed the small 2nd floor balcony and the open air roof top seating.  Even though on a busy street, the noise did not disturb us at all.  Also lots of great food options within the 2 Block radius. Muchos Gracias!"
50,"Meraki is a great boutique hotel. We stayed here for 2 nights and it was always monitored, highly secure, very comfortable and the rooms are very cute. The breakfast is great, and the wifi is very reliable. They take care of everything for you. We had a 4am departure from the hotel and they gave us breakfast to go."
40,"This tiny hotel has only a handful of rooms. It is very clean, very safe and in an excellent neighborhood of Guate. It's a little bit weird and quirky but comfortable and with good service. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
50,I only stayed one night with very late arrival but the Meraki is super nice and the staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and nicely renovated. For breakfast you can have a buffet in the Restaurant or order what you like in the coffee shop next door. I went for the coffee shop and it was fantastic. 
40,"Overall I enjoyed my stay at Patricia's Hotel - the place has a very cosy and welcoming atmosphere, and is located in a nice, safe and quiet area of town.  It's also excellent value for money, in a city which seems to have overly expensive accommodations.  Whilst it's out of the central area of the city, the owners can easily arrange transport for you to visit various places.  Patricia herself is a wonderful hostess, very friendly and helpful.  I loved the fact that the hotel offered free airport transfers, and indeed they picked me up from there upon my arrival.  Breakfast is nice, whilst for lunch and/or dinner there is an extensive selection of food menus you can choose from to be delivered by local restaurants.  I was a little disappointed with my room, which had no window"
40,"I spent one night upon my  arrival,  the family was very nice and offered pick up service from airport and drop off service the next day.   The room was clean and the bed comfortable .  I would not hesitate to go back. "
30,We have passed here 2 nights. Safe in secured area. The service of transport is kind and the location is very close to the aeroport. Breakfast included is ok with fruits. The owner is really in attention for transports but nothing else as cook. The bed are clean but the room and the bathroom are dusty (dust everywhere). I recommand this place only for aeroport proximity and safe.
40,"We were getting into Guatemala City late and leaving early the next morning for Tikal. Patricia's picked us up from the airport on time, even though our flight arrived an hour early! The room is basic with a shared bathroom and we had no complaints. There was some music playing in the building next door but once we turned the fan on we weren't bothered by it and slept well. They also dropped us off at the airport the next morning for a 6am flight. Overall really great service."
50,"Very good service and helpful Staff! One Way Airport Shuttle and Breakfast is included. Room was simple and clean, shared Bathroom was also nice and clean. Perfect for late arrivals or early departures"
50,"My wife and I stayed at Casa Serena for almost five months as we waited for our shipment to arrive from the U.S. It was a wonderful stay and the staff really make you feel like you are at home. You are close to ""La Zona Viva"" which really has everything you would need to eat and drink outside of your home. There is a very nice mall with a movie theater within walking distance, as well as a supermarket.   The rooms are very spacious and the breakfast served every morning is delightful. Casa Serena really makes you feel at home and while we are happy to have finally moved into our place we will always consider the Casa Serena our second home!"
50,"This was very nice for the price and given that we were a family of five a much better value than having to book two rooms somewhere else or squeezing into a single room with two double beds and someone on the floor elsewhere.  It was even a better deal than two rooms at a much less nice place. Our suite had two bedrooms, a living room and kitchen area.  Also, this hotel has been recently renovated so everything is very new (not like the traveler photos above).  We also needed a late night meal and just wanted something easy and close. Its near several places to eat. We were only there for one quick night, but they had our 4:00 am ride to the airport waiting for us."
50,"Recently renovated Casa Serena offers great apart/hotel experience in the middle of Zone 10 (zona viva). It offers pool service, breakfast and free wifi. Staff is very nice with hotel guests. Free parking for your vehicle. Affordable prices. Pet friendly. "
50,"The hotel was recommended to us by a businessman familiar with Guatemala City after we missed our flight due to horrific traffic from Antigua.  Despite the early morning arrival, the receptionist immediately arranged our rooms and offered us breakfast in the small dining room.  Both rooms that we were assigned were suites - mine was huge, with two bedrooms, shared bathroom, living room, dining room, and kitchen; my traveling companions' room was even more cavernous, with two bedrooms, each with en suite bathroom, larger living room, boardroom-sized dining room, and a kitchen I wish I had in my house in California!  The hotel is modern, spacious, open, and located in Zone 1 (the safe zone) near Mr. Sushi and Chevy's.  A full hot breakfast with omelets to order was included with"
50,"Casa Serena is a good apartment hotel located in one of the safest zones in Guatemala City, and it is very close to the airport (about 15 minutes). The rooms are clean, spacious, and they come with a mini kitchen. The breakfast does not have a variety but it is decent: there is a lady who would prepare your eggs omelet based on what ingredients you want. The breakfast is included in your room price. This is a good starting point to explore the city and beyond. The hotel has 24-hr security which makes you feel you are safe inside the premises at all times. A security guard will not let any stranger go inside the hotel unless there is a good reason. Great place for the price you pay."
40,"Located in a very safe zone, this hotel offers really good service. The room are really good, hot water, room service, free Wi-Fi, smokers area, and also have a very nice restaurant open 24/7. It counts with laundry service, rooftop, pool and wheelchair access "
50,"Highly recommend this place, we have stayed here 4 times and will continue to do so every time we travel to Guatemala .  This is a great place to stay and not to mention it is a great price. The staff is very helpful and friendly, they will make sure you are happy and comfortable . The breakfast is amazing , you can order room service from the cafeteria and everything is very tasty. "
50,"We stayed here on our way in and our way out of Guate.  I had emailed the hotel beforehand to ask for a ride from the airport to the hotel and they quickly emailed back with the transport all set up. Our flight in was two hours late and I had had no way to contact the hotel to let them know, but even so the hotel driver was front and center as we got out of the airport.  I was so relieved.  He really had waited there the whole two hours until we arrived.  The hotel is small and comfortable.  Great location.  I took my morning coffee up to the rooftop terrace with a great variety of plants and a couple of macaws to make it feel less like we were in the middle of the city.  Rooms come with complimentary breakfast for two guests (extra folks are only about $5 per person) and the"
50,"We stayed here on a recent mission trip. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant had great food and great service. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. There were armed security on the grounds, safe environment."
40,"Good Hotel with very good location. Situated in very safe Zona 10 . High floor are really quiet calm .Room service is very slow,Reception & restaurent  staffs are  familiar with English.Rooms are good and spacious ."
30,"I wish they would step up their services   Charging for gym access at the their partner company the Weston is disappointing.  The breakfast offering is good, but a bit basic.  WIsh there were more offerings"
40,"Biltmore is a well located, clean, friendly staff, now with a new exercise room downstairs and room service available at all hours.  My only complaint is that there is way to make coffee or tea in the room."
50,"We’ve stayed at this hotel several times during the last three years. The staff treat guests as family. This friendly staff is the secret of this hotel such us Oscar, Monica, Diana, Gerson and Jefferson! Every time we’re headed to Guatemala we look forward to seeing you. Breakfast and dining area is the best with coffee and tea available throughout the day. Safe area, variety of restaurants around and nice rooms with comfortable beds."
40,"Literally spent a few hours at the Biltmore.  Room was clean, bed and pillows were comfortable, had all the bathroom amenities including a hair dryer and water was potable.  Left before breakfast was served, so can not comment on."
50,"We were pleasantly surprised by how impeccably sparkling clean the hotel and rooms are kept. Room service was there each and every day, including Sunday. The morning breakfast buffet was nicely set out at 6 AM every morning we went there with fresh coffee, fruits, juices, cereals, cooked breakfast course ( usually scrambled eggs, sausages, pancakes), pastries, yoghurts etc. There are restaurants and bars in the adjoining and nearby hotels; plus, several fast food spots within 1 to 2 blocks including Taco Bell and Mono Loco ""crazy monkey"" with huge portioned nachos. - - If you have planned a tour; local tour guides are quite prompt. The Biltmore offers shuttle service to and from the airport at $10 per person. We would go back to the Biltmore if we are in Guatemala again."
40,"The room I stayed in had a kitchen (with dishes), living room/ dining room area, hot water in the bathroom, two queen beds, and a TV in the bedroom and living room. My bathroom also had a hair dryer and the bedroom had lots of closet space, a big dresser, and an alarm clock. It was very roomy and had a great view. The only downside was that the wireless internet only worked in a certain part of the living room for me and other guests seemed to have to come down to the lobby to use theirs. But since there was a business center with computers and a printer, it was not a problem. The breakfast was included and all of the other dishes I tried there were tasty as well. The small gym has weights and basic cardio machines. Some of the cardio machines were a bit squeaky, but there are"
40,"The suites are more like an apartment. The suite we stayed in had a kitchen, large bathroom with shower (no bath tub), living room, dressing area, and bedroom with two full size beds and a balcony. There was a television in both the living room and bedroom. The hotel restaurant is for use by hotel guests only. The staff was very friendly. The hotel is very clean. The food was good. I think overall it's a great value. Our suite included pick up/drop off at the airport and daily breakfast. This hotel is NOT like a Marriott or Hilton. It's a local hotel. It does not have a pool or any other ""entertainment."" There is a small work out room, but we didn't use it. There is a small bar in the (small) restaurant.  There is a shopping center with a Burger King within blocks of this hotel. "
40,"I am staying at the Suites Reforma Apart Hotel for a couple of weeks. Suites Reforma is at a great location in Zona Viva, very clean and I have a complete kitchen and huge bathroom.  The staff could not be nicer or friendlier- The are willing to help me with anything I need and are constantly asking if I do need anything and how things are -yet the staff is discreet. The private restaurant has a somewhat small menu but everything I ordered was very good (they do have room service for a small fee extra). Breakfast is included.  While this property does not have a pool and lacks some of the amenities that a fancier hotel may offer (that I really don't want to pay for or need during my stay). There is no air conditioner, but that did not matter as the suite stayed a perfect"
50,"From the beginning I was impressed and it continued to grow during each interaction with staff at reception, luggage handling, doormen, business center and housekeeping.  Everyone was professional, friendly and helpful - going out of their way to show courtesy.  The rooms were excellent, beds comfortable, bathrobes cozy and great wifi."
50,"I love this hotel, it has a modern look from the outside but inside it is very regal, grand and stylish and plush. The hotel service was impeccable and the room service and maid service were exemplary. Superb 5 star hotel and extremely clean and well maintained. The included buffet breakfast was one of the very best we have ever been too! We will definitely be back!"
30, the breakfast buffet is now served Differently than in previous years. Too bad.... Same great selection ... but the food is no longer kept hot.  The only thing kept the same as before. Is The Omelette station... And that is still quite excellent.
50,I have stayed in this hotel multiple times and it has always been a positive experience. Staff are friendly and the location is great. The breakfast buffet is delicious and offers many options from Guatemalan cuisine.
40,"We stayed for three nights in this hotel, third night in Maya tower. This Barcelo is not in the same class as other Barcelo hotels I have stayed in. It is dated upkeep not as good. Breakfast was good but tea / coffee terrible. Our room was close to lifts and ice machine and so sleep quality was terrible. Beware that if one asks for a ""double bed"" in Guatemala it means ""twin beds""!"
40,"Good place to stay if you need to get to the airport early. 1 minute taxi ride. Secure compound and box breakfast provided. Rooms are adequate, clean,and hot shower. Only complaint would be people talking loudly in the courtyard later than I would prefer."
30,"The beautiful lobby and restaurant of the hotel made us want to try a stay in the Royal Palace. Of course the location is excellent too, right in the middle of a pedestrian only shopping street, near the Central Park.  Our experiences with the hotel are a bit mixed. To start with the positive: nice large parking lot and parking included in the price. The breakfast is also included and good enough, serving staff is nice. The free internet is super fast and available in the rooms. And last but not least the wonderful bathroom with plenty hot water. On the downside: the rooms are kind of small, very enclosed and therefore warm. The airco and the fan are of the older type and very noisy. You can't turn them off in order not to suffocate but it is like sleeping underneath a running"
10,Stayed one night as close to airport.  Very dirty and run down. No AC and no screens on windows. No hot water in sink.  No restaurant even nearby or in hotel. Rooms are tiny with no storage and few outlets. Never again!
50,"My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel, we had the suite and the space was incredible.  The hotel does have an amazing ambience, worth the price of it.  It is located in a very convenient area right next to GC airport.  The staff is friendly and will support you with any question you might have, they can arrange your transportation to the airport upon request.  They accept Debit and Credit Card.  Thanks to all the staff for giving us such a good service. "
50,"Really beautiful hotel and it is super close to the airport which was perfect for us! We were flying to Flores just for the day to see Tikal so this hotel was a great base for us. The staff is amazing, so helpful and even gave us little care bags of juice and a snack for the airplane ride! So sweet! "
50,"Very nice hotel next to the airport. We had a room with a balcony on the garden (the view from the rooms on the court yard is not nice) and it was very nice. Room is nicely decorated and very spacious. The staff is very friendly and helped us to get a cab (and nwgogiate the price...)to town. Breakfast is OK,  you have a choice of 5 type of breakfast. Just a shame that you do not have any free juice of fruits with it. The airport is small so no traffic at night so we slept like babies. A place that I recommend for traveller like us who need to fly the next day "
50,"I was very pleased with my experience at this lovely hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are beautiful and remind me of the days of glamor and class in world travel.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  The bathrooms are large and clean.  I had plenty of hot water and good water pressure. I was very happy with the Salamander cerveceria ""beer bar"".  It is tucked into a corner of the lobby with windows looking out onto the 6 Ave. scene. The beer is ICE COLD, and is drawn from a tap.  This is one of the only places in Guatemala that serves fresh beer from the tap. Parking is free and is very secure.  And you have the newly improved 6 Ave. at your doorway.  Now for the down side. Do not expect the hotel to answer emails, or accept reservations over the internet.  This was"
50,I am sorry to hear all this complaints but I have to say that I stayed at this hotel and had a wonderful staying the staff were very nice and helpful and the driver that took me to the airport very courteous
10,"We came here back in May and we had a horrible experience. We did not like the way the front desk treated us the last three days we had a bad experience because our keys wouldn't work. As we were going to have our breakfast which is extremely NASTY we came back to our room the card key was blocked and it was a pain in the butt because we had to keep asking the front desk to fix the issue. What was even worse was that the women in the front desk kept on blaming each other on whose fault it was. They alleged saying that the electronic system wasn't working and that the Hotel manager and human resources were aware of the problem, but was really pissed us off was that at the restaurant e found the manager and he gave us a hypocrite smile promised to fix the problem but was a Huge"
20,The security staff treats you like a criminal.  There were problems with the water and I was unable to shower before going to the airport for my flight back to the states and they all but refused to make an appropriate adjustment to my bill for the inconvenience.  They finally did adjust one night off the bill after calling the manager and confirming that I was paying in US dollars (and after I threatened to pay them nothing at all).  Nothing about this hotel with the exception of the central location would encourage me to return.  I won't be back. 
50,After traveling guate for about a month central 10 was a great last stop before my long flight home . I was at first a bit worried about Guatemala City but staying in this area of the city that I found safe and modern . The hostel was clean had all the facility’s you would expect as well as some nice in and outdoor seating . The staff spoke english and helped me get to airport on time thankyou daphne !!! I was glad I took the time to see a place that is oftern overlooked . guate city !!!!
50,Absolutely great experience all around at Central 10! The place is well designed and super clean. The pool is perfect for the almost continuous sunny weather Guatemala has to offer. Beds are super comfortable. Prob the best location for a hostel in Guatemala City. Lots of restaurants near by and it is in a super safe area. I highly recommend this place !
50,"It’s an absolutely gorgeous hostel with wonderful owners and staff. Rooms, showers, toilets and common areas are kept clean at all times.  It’s located in a very good neighborhood very close to the airport. They also have a pool!  Soon there’s going to be a cool rooftop with a bar!"
50,Very clean and new. I was very impressed. Nice pool. Lots of space to breath. Walking distance from all the good spots. Dorm beds were clean and new. Showers were hot. Staff and owner were very nice and helpful. Great spot!
50,"We booked this place almost the night before we arrived and it was worth choosing here. It’s in zone 10 that happens to be the safest zone in the city, it’s close to the Airport. The rooms are very clean and the beds are nice. We never went into the pool but it was clean and had a nice court side. We stayed in a room with 3 punk beds but they also have private rooms which aren’t much more in price. We will definitely be back next year . The showers have hot water which was amazing for us since we weren’t used to the cold.  It has a Kitchen with the basics so you can cook which we did one night ...   I really recommend this hostel .. "
50,"Lunch was delicious, fast and the service is excellent.  The portions are plentiful and varied. We had a buffet and there were several choices. The decor is modern and cozy. They used local art, fabrics and colors which pop off the walls."
50,"I celebrating a wedding here. Everything was wonderful, the waiters, they helped with the schedule because the traffic in zone 10 is horrible, specially in business days. I recommend a place where big  glass doors comunicate with the garden, the photos come out beautifully with all that green color."
40,"I stayed here on business for two nights in May 2019.  I am not sure of the age of this hotel, but it looks very new.  The overall condition of the property is excellent.  When you arrive at this hotel on the ground level, you will need to take the elevator up to the lobby level.  Check in was very good; the staff was friendly and spoke English, which I appreciate.    My room was very comfortable, especially the bed.  The size and amenities were what I have come to expect from Courtyard.  I took breakfast both days.  It was good, not great.  The restaurant is open to the lobby, which is fine, but it also leads to a bit of confusion in the morning.  People are walking through the lobby and into the restaurant, and nobody really appears to kno who is eating breakfast and who is"
50,The staff and food and amenities was Primetime. Jorge offered to bring us food upstairs as we had our 91 year old Dalmatian who we weee bringing back from the dead. He had been attacked a couple of weeks prior so we came out to Guatemala to help out. Don’t forget to try the green chicken tortilla soup. Excellente! 
50,"As most Courtyard I have stayed, this one is excellent.  It is a new propperty located on a nice neighborhood(Zone 10), the common areas are very quiet and relaxing; my husband and I loved our room, the bed is so comfortable! What makes this place special is its staff, kuddos to all of them. I thank the young woman  at the front desk who helped us with the check in, she made possible that we had a room ready before the real check in time, that was nice especially after an overnight flight.  In addition, we found the food delicious! Very professional people in the restaurant, special thanks to Oscar, who was always so willing to make us feel happy and Jessica, who took care of our  guest room, it is evident that these people love what they do. Thank you all of you."
50,"We stayed here one night before leaving Guatemala City to go home. We had a private room for two and I think we were the only guests at the time. The owners were very helpful, the woman in particular made us feel like family! It's in a gated community so you'll feel very safe here. The shuttle would not take me to the national terminal of the airport but they have a friendly reliable taxi driver that was able to get me there. There isn't a whole lot to do here, just a common space with a TV and a nice garden area with a hammock, but it is very clean and tidy and for one night it was perfect! The owner also assisted us in ordering in food for dinner. We left too early for breakfast but they let us put snacks in the fridge for in the morning. Highly recommend this hostel! "
50,"So close to the airport with comfortable beds, hot water and great wifi. The owners are very friendly and we always felt safe as it's in a gated community and you need to be buzzed in to enter the property! Excellent accommodation for a night to two if you need to be close to the airport, highly recommended. "
50,This is a perfect layover hotel in Guatemala City.  It is clean and the people are wonderful.  I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone.  I had a meeting and they even served us cookies and tea.  The airport service was great.
40,Spent one night with a group before heading to Lake Atilan area. Good clean basic rooms. With TVs and Internet. Great hearty breakfast in the morning. Really close to the airport in a secured area. Owners very helpful and accommodating. 
50,"Very cozy and clean place. The staff and managers were very helpful and nice, setting our stay with no prior reservation. The hostel is located in a surrounded area, making it secure to wander around. Not to mention the great price for the dorms :)"
40,"We stayed here 1 night after flying in late to Guatemala City. The hotel has a cute little garden courtyard and the room had unique décor. The beds were extremely comfortable after a long haul from Australia. The hotel has a choice of a café or a restaurant for breakfast. We chose a typico breakfast from the restaurant, which was good. There was a nightclub nearby playing loud thumping music when we checked in late so we found the ear plugs were a necessity."
50,"The location of this hotel is excellent! Everything was nearby, we walked to Oakland mall, Plaza Fontabella, San Martin, Mcdonalds etc. The room is very comfortable and pretty, everything seems new. The bed was great! I can never sleep on hotel beds but this one was so comfy. Service was good but they said they provided airport shuttle and when we asked they told us what they do is call an uber for their guests which of course guests have to pay. Besides that everything was great."
50,"Small beautiful hotel with great service.  We love everything about the meraki. The location, the service, the clean and beautiful rooms, the free water, the complimentary breakfast, the parking!! Its our favorite hotel in the city.  Reasonably priced and worth every penny."
50,"First time on this type of boutique hotel but the attention was excellent, room was clean and organized.  The wifi works fine to do my job work at night.  The bed and sheets was very cozy and relaxing.  I'll be stay here easy next time that I had to come.  The restaurant food is very good. "
40,"A very nice, cosy hotel. Great location (close to business and restaurants) and excellent service. A relaxed ""hipster"" kind of café terrace offering good food and coffee. Restaurant offers good food at excellent prices."
50,"This place is very near the airport and can be noisy as planes take off and land. Otherwise it is a quiet and secure place to spend the night. They will pick you up from the airport for free with advanced notice. They also provide a free breakfast which for me was two pieces of French toast, two slices of watermelon and a banana. Coffee and tea were also provided. The beds were comfortable and the shared bathrooms were kept clean. You probably would not want to spend more than one night here as there is not much else around but apartments. But for one night, it is great for the budget traveler."
50,"We have been using Patricia's for almost 4 years, and we've never been disappointed. Alberto and his mom are friendly, punctual, and very helpful. The last time we were in Guate, I thought I had made a reservation with them, but I hadn't.   :(  I discovered this the night before, and I emailed Alberto about it. Even though we weren't staying there, Alberto went out of his way to call two different hostels to find a place for us. He even provided transportation from the airport to the hostel and then again to the bus station the next morning- all of that even though we didn't even stay at their hostel!   We stayed at Guatefriends, and while it was a fine place to stay, we like Patricia's better because of the service and the layout of the rooms. We'll definitely be back! "
50,"Patricia picked us up from the airport, allowed us to order food, made us breakfast and dropped us at the bus terminal. What else do you need when traveling? A comfortable bed and a nice shower right? Don't worry you can get it all here! The noise of the planes can be worrying when you first arrive but it's okay as the air traffic decreases a lot with night fall. Enjoy your stay here!"
40,"This hostel is located very close to the airport and is a very good option to stay when getting in and out of Guatemala. Just munutes away from the airport and transport to/from is included as well as breakfast. Quiet, safe and clean, hot shower and wifi and the staff is very nice and friendly. The outside area and garden is good for relaxing before or after a flight. I will absolutely get back here for my next visit"
40,"We stayed one night at Patricia's hostal. There is everything you need : pick up for free at the airport, comfortable rooms, hostal very clean and very secure, hot shower, soap... Nice breakfast. It's very quiet, excepting the noise of the planes. No supermarket around but you can eat in a little restaurant or order. Good option if you arrive or leave Guate. The family is very nice, we could stay all day long in the hostal even after cheking out and then owner drive us to our next place"
40,"Our friends recommended us to book our stay in Casa Serena. However, we weren't lucky to get reservations at the beginning. We took our chances after we reached Guatemala. Casa Serena situated in Zone 10 is probably the safest neighborhood in town. Studio open kitchen with finely crafted furniture. Very Spacious rooms one with king and another with queen size bed. More than enough storage space with a dedicated router for wi-fi. Although, i think the showers needs to be little better than what they have now. Staff is very courteous. A restaurant, pool, gym and laundry. You have everything you need in here.   Restaurants and grocery are at walking distance and a night club ""Fish & Go"" is right across the street.  The room tariffs are placed at much better rates than compared to"
50,"I had to be in Guatemala City for 1 month for work and stayed at the Hotel Casa Serena. This is the PERFECT place for long-term stays. The rooms were very spacious and had a full kitchen, with cooking ware, separate living/dinning room, walk in closet and spacious bathroom. Breakfast was included, however, room services is limited to 9pm."
30,"I stay in Casa Serena for 1 month. All the staff was very helpful and always willing to make you feel like at home. Overall the hotel was very clean, enough personnel to keep it neat ( hard working people). The hotel has 24 hrs security, and felt safe; however, surrounded by restaurants. bars, party salons that makes Casa Serena an impossible place to sleep starting on thursday night, escalating on fridays and saturdays. If you are unlucky and your room is next to the party salon, it will be impossible for you and your family to sleep because  they play the music SOOO loud that even the walls vibrate. One really good thing about casa serena is that they have their own parking place, which is a big plus, cause during weekends the area is so crowded that it is impossible to find a"
50,"I stayed 2 weeks & was in a 2 bedroom apartment.  It was very spacious & comfortable.  I really enjoyed the flexibility of cooking for myself in the equipped kitchen.  It was my first time in Guatemala & the hotel staff was incredibly helpful.  The included breakfast was always delicious.  I didn't get to use the pool, due to it already getting chilly, but it looked very nice & I'm sure is great when the weather is hot.  I'd very much recommend this place!  I'm even going to stay here in the future when I take my mom to visit Guatemala."
50,"I have stayed in Casa Serena on five different trips in the past three years, and, I have to say that I have always received great rates, and top notch service, from the Sales/Reservation department,  all the way to the cook that prepares my eggs every morning.  The rooms are well and tastefully appointed, with very comfortable beds, a full kitchen and a nice living/dining room.  The hotel has a small, but very nice pool, and a multi-use entertainment room, with billiards and air hockey, and a huge TV.  Only breakfast is served at the hotel, but they can procure for you any type of food you want from a plethora of nearby restaurants, without charging you an arm and a leg.  For me, Casa Serena is the only choice when I visit Guatemala."
50,Excellent service and accommodation! Very clean. Buffet breakfast was delicious. Had access to the Westin pool and gym which was nice for only an extra $10.00.   Staff was very helpful and friendly.   I would stay again! 
50,Everything was perfect from the moment you checked in to check out.  The inclusive breakfast was well rounded    Room temperature was the best in my opinion husband almost froze to death.    Loved the overall experience 
50,"I went for a business trip. the hotel is located in zone 10 where there are many restaurants and bars, therefore. even if there is no restaurant inside the hotel this is not a problem. the staff very friendly and ready with any request. Very polite and sipatico. Good room cleaning service and also the very eficient laundry service. great For sure come bak again"
50,"Hotel was lovely and much nicer than I was expecting since it was included with our package. Breakfast was always a wide spread of options and always fresh. Rooms were clean, smelled good, and updated. Very pleased with our entire stay. Hotel staff were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. "
40,Stayed one night - arriving at 2100 departing at 0900 day after. But a good nights sleep and more than that - a very functional and fast wifi as well as a splendid breakfast (which i enjoyed for one hour). Good service. (Even if the shuttle bus driver from hotel was sleeping in the bus so it was first quite difficult to find the shuttle as he wasn’t standing with the sign in the arrivals area - but after calling the hotel they guided me to the correct bus).
40,"We arrived at 11pm and the complementary airport shuttle was waiting for us. It only took about 10 mins door to door. Armed guards at the hotel entrance. Large room 2 double beds. Clean, nice hot shower, breakfast made to order, helpful receptionist organized our onward transport. Would stay again."
30,This was the smallest room I have ever in my life stayed in!! I could not even open my suitcase all the way on the floor!!! The bed pretty much took up the whole space. Pretty disappointed in it. Would not stay again. Super loud too!
40,"We spent only one night here. A little bit expencive for me, but very good. I really like a decoration of room, wich was really clean and big enough. An aircon is old, but not too noisy. Good breakfast. Stuff is very friendly and helpful. We ordered some dishes to our room from the restaurant and all of them were cooked very well and tasty. Can recommend it to anyone."
40,"You can't beat the value of this place. Super convenient location, nice free airport shuttle, friendly staff, clean rooms, awesome wifi in the room, and a decent breakfast included. We had an unexpected layover in Guatemala City, and we were just so grateful to find this deal."
50,"This is the first time I've stayed at any HoJo's and I had a very pleasant experience.  They staff were great and bent over backwards for me.  The rooms were stylish and comfortable, the breakfast pleasant, if not generous.  I stayed twice.  The first room I had was nicer, but was smaller to the point of being a bit cramped.  I missed having space in the bathroom to put my toiletries, for example.  The first room was also a bit noisier as it was facing the busy Avenida Reforma.  The second room was much more spacious and quiet, but lacked any serious windows, so I highly recommend you let them know your preferences when you check in."
40,I have stayed at the Guat City Barcelo MANY times. Always good except for the fact that I am constantly going back down to the front desk to get fresh electronic keys. Very annoying. Its about time they fixed or replaced their key system..
50,All staff members were kind and helpful. Food was tasty in the restaurant.  Rooms were very clean.  All the hotel amenities were more than expected.  The beds and pillows were very comfy.  I would stay at this hotel again.
50,"This hotel is very clean and staff is very friendly! The wifi is great and the view is awesome. Im not sure if all the hotels in Guatemala are similar, but you have to use your key to access elevator and also to turn your lights on, something I didn't know. Awesome stay for American and United Airlines Employees!!! "
50,Barcelo is a great hotel be abuse from beginning  to end you are well taken care of.  They are good at taking care of the small things and providing you with an oasis of tranquility in the midst of the hustle and bustle of a business trip.
50,Come here for work a few times a year. Always insist staying in this hotel rather then going with my colleagues to other hotels. Rooms are confortable and the service is good. The staff is also very nice and helpful.
50,"Very nice Courtyard property. If you are using their shuttle from the airport, make sure to book it AHEAD give them your flight info and they will be waiting for you. After waiting for one hour, we finally took a cab! Didn't know we had to book ahead. In a good location 10 mins or less from airport. The breakfast is inexpensive (i believe about $12) per person for a full buffet. The weekday buffet is excellent, weekends not so much. It's an all you can eat with lots of choices fresh fruit, eggs, also eggs made to order included and pancakes too. Rooms are clean. We were upgraded to a suite- it was HUGE. Nice beautiful balcony. Clean, nice bathrooms, good linens. Lots of little extras you usually see in a full service Marriott."
50,This property is new and fresh and stunning! We loved our stay and this is way better than the already good but 3-4 star Courtyards in the USA. This truly felt like a 5 star hotel. Food was excellent. Amazingly clean everywhere all the time. Rooms are fresh and spacious and up to date. We now prefer this over the Barcelo when we visit Guate.
50,I spent around 3 days back and forth on this property. Service was amazing and location is great. Guest service agents going beyond their ways to fulfill your needs. My only disappointment was when I requested shaving kit and which is normally a free amenity here You get charge as well my room was booked for 2 people and bathroom amenities were for 1 only. Coffee must be more than 2 capsules as well or better coffee station on that beautiful lobby.
40,"Having been to Guatemala about 50+ times in the past ten years: Pros: Fantastic location in zone 10, directly across the street from great Greek restaurant (Del Griego, see separate review); snack shops, taxi stand; 3 blocks from Fontabella shopping center (small and tasteful, best bookstore in Central America (Librería Sophos, second floor, open 7 days a week with its own restaurant) Great service, especially at the bar/restaurant (Hilda, Oscar Santos)  Nice public spaces with ports for personal computer Good food/wine Clean rooms  Small refrigerator Efficient front desk Mini-mart (snacks, beer)  Cons: Small rooms, no workspace;, dim lighting; my room had view of skyscraper   Small gym: 3 treadmills, one elliptical, one recumbent bike; some weights and small weight station;"
40,"We've stayed at quite a few Courtyard Mariotts, so we were surprised when this one did not have a pool and their breakfast was not free. The front desk called the Radison across the street and we were able to use their outdoor jacquizzis (which were more like small pools with cool water). But it was a nice gesture.   The hot breakfast buffet was very good with local Guatemalan food and some more US styled stuff as well.  Rooms were VERY nice and modern and clean.  Airport shuttle was $40 USD per person!!! Crazy! We were able to get a taxi for $10 USD total.  I do recommend this place for a reasonable, safe, nice hotel in Guatemala City."
40,Close to the airport: a modern comfortable boutique hotel. Friendly helpful staff. Close to a mall with plenty of restaurant options. Very pleasant rooms. Attention to detail. Takeaway breakfast provided for early departure.
50,"We spent a night at Hostal Los Lagos Inn in Guatemala City after missing our flight to Flores and having to re-arrange for the next morning.   The owners were very sweet and helpful in accommodating us and even offered free transport to the airport.   The room was very quiet, clean and had free wifi.   I would recommend the hostal to anyone looking for nice, no frills accommodation in Guatemala City."
20,"I booked a night and paid a deposit two weeks in advance via hostelworld.com. We arrived at 7 pm after a long bus ride from San Pedro La Laguna and despite having booked in advance, they did not have our room available and shuttled us off to another hostel nearby of lesser quality (hostal los valcones). The manager/owner was not even apologetic about it and gave no explanation. At the other location, they did not have a room ready for us right away. They also charged an extra 10% fee for using credit card, the highest I have ever encountered. All in all, I'd say I was disappointed with the experience."
50,"This was a very quiet and safe bed and breakfast in a gated community right near the airport.  The owners picked me up after my flight free of charge, and arranged a taxi for me to get to the bus station the next day.  The room was clean, the shower was hot, and in addition to free airport transfer, a hot breakfast was provided for me in the morning.  Very basic, but for the cost this was an excellent value and was the perfect option for my stay upon arriving and before beginning my adventure to the rest of Guatemala."
40,"This was the first time I stayed in a hostel and I really like, the owners Mr. Luis and his wife Mariloly They were nice since my arrival I stayed for 4 nights, helped me with everything I had doubts and guided me very well (if it was like my home away from her) The room was very clean (that was my biggest concern) the place where the hostel is very safe and just 1 minute from the airport. They are free shuttle to and from the airport. Certainly for my next trips I will stay in a hostel is a very different experience and I enjoy it.  Greetings and thanks to Mr. Luis and his wife."
50,"We just stayed one night, on our way to Mexico.  As other reviewers have said, it's a very friendly place where you made to feel welcome.  Our room was quite small and rather basic (with a bathroom that could do with a refurbishment), but we had everything we needed, including a TV.  There is a pleasant dining/sitting area with TV and videos, and a little garden.  The staff recommended a restaurant in the city for us, and ordered a taxi to take us there.  We had to leave too early to sample the breakfast, but we were given a lift to the airport at 4.30 in the morning.  We would recommend this B&B and will return any time we need a night in Guatemala City."
40,"We chose villa toscana because we had an early flight in the morning. And like most of the tourists did, we did not visit Guatemala City but Antigua.  But if you have an early flight like us, staying in Guatemala City the night before is a must as the traffic from Antigua to Guatemala City is really bad in the morning according to information by locals.  We took a late transfer from Antigua to Villa Toscana. When we arrived Guatemala City it was around 10 at night, our driver found a bit hard to find the place. Later we know why as the hotel area and the street nearby is blocked by a gate. It means that Guatemala City is really dangerous but the hotel is safe. Our driver called them to ask for direction, but turns out the staff is kind of rude to tell him to find it by himself."
50,"This Hostal is clean, comfortable, and charming enough for being two minutes away from the airport and in a residential district. It has free shuttle service to and from the airport. The service was excellent from the owners to the staff. We had the choice room up top - very comfortable king bed and living space. Enjoyable patio/garden for eating or working. What I liked least is that it was expensive for getting food delivered. $40 American for a large pizza and a couple of drinks. (Vegetarian options scarce)."
50,"Villa Toscana very convenient . Close to the airport. Clean , good staff . Breakfast a very good breakfast included .  Good price and very nice rooms . They are upgrading the place so I think that will be great 👍🏻  "
40,"A very nice little hotel. The evening manager was great, spoke fluent English and was very helpful.  The courtyard and gardens were special!  If just overnighting for the airport you will probably find all the little hotels in this area can be busy/noisy through the night with travelers coming and going.  If peace and quiet is important I suspect the second level rooms would be best.  If you are looking for peace and quiet I would not recommend any of the hotels in this area, but the location is perfect for travelers."
40,"Very cosy decor in the rooms and common area. The room itself was clean and spacious. Staff were professional and friendly. Airport transportation and breakfast were included. 3 minute drive from airport. Internet was fast. All in all, very good value for what was paid."
50,"I stayed here for 16 days for work & was very pleased with everything.  The staff was super nice & helpful; my apartment was very clean & comfortable for my long stay.  I enjoyed having the kitchen, as it made eating around my schedule & budget much nicer.  I was really pleased to find out that breakfast was included in my room rate, too!  I was able to do a lot of sight seeing in Guate City itself, plus to Antigua & Tikal on my off-time."
50,"My review is very much like CISWanderer's - fantastic place!  Stayed about 6 weeks from late Aug - Oct. 2011.  If you are in Guate long term -this is the place - most guests are waiting on finding permanent housing.  There is a pool, hot tub, playground and lovely breakfast area. I, too, loved eating outside and letting my kid play while I enjoyed the rest of my breakfast.  Staff is great, location is great - close to restaurants, parks, zoo, mall, grocery store.  The place is decorated very nicely as well - love the furniture and art - need to fine out where I can get it!!"
50,"I stayed at Casa Serena for a little over a month with my family, and we had an absolutely wonderful stay.  The rooms were large and well-kept (especially the newly renovated wing), with great cleaning and hospitality staff who quickly responded to any requests.  It was great to eat breakfast outside in the mornings, with one of the perks being that my children could play in the playground while I finished my cappuccino and fresh fruit in the mornings.  The pool was a nice temperature, and the children in the hotel loved it.  Finally, the front desk staff were a joy.  I recommend this hotel for family and business travelers who want an oasis in the middle of Guatemala City instead of a sterile business hotel."
50,"I have been travelling to Guatemala many times and each time I stay in the Casa Serena, a very nice, clean hotel with a great service and wonderful staff, located in a safe area of the city. I love the style of the hotel.They are remodeling, refurbishing and enlarging the hotel for the moment and the result will probably be a modern hotel. Very much to recommend. We never were bothered by the ongoing work. The breakfast area is already finished and breakfast is wonderful as always. This is for people who prefer the warm, familiar atmosphere and don´t like to stay in sterile hotels looking one like the other. Besides, the rooms are very spacious, so it is an exellent value. I come back there every time I visit Guatemala and take this opportunity to thank the wonderful people"
50,"This hotel is lovely, the rooms are generous, and decorated beautifully.  They are also quiet, and just a short walk to whatever you may need. The breakfast served will satisfy any appetite.  Casa Serena's staff is professional, and customer oriented.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and are planning another visit soon. "
40,"It was such a relief to have someone there at the airport to pick us up right when we landed. Not having to find a ride and an affordable hotel after a day of flying was worth everything. They were very kind and helped us get back to the airport the next morning to get on a shuttle to Antigua.  The shower, though shared, was one of the cleanest I've seen in all of Guatemala. The bed, though just a full, was sleepable and clean. Internet was great. And breakfast the next morning was a big plus.   Overall a great first experience in Guatemala. Met all out needs at our buget. "
30,"Stayed here because charged less for pickup from domestic terminal (TAG flight pickups are not free). Son picked us up with sign at TAG hangar. Little contact with Patricia herself aside from greeting and serving us breakfast in morning. Room was small, TV in shared space. OK for one night but probably wouldn't stay here again."
50,"Fantastic value, ultra safe location, clean, and everything you need for an overnight stay next to the airport.  Alberto will make sure you are well looked after.  Strong Wifi throughout hotel.  Hot shower.  Free shuttle to and from airport."
40,I have used Patricia's a number of times when fllying into and out of Guatemala.  I often need to spend a night in Guateala City because of the timing of my flights.  They are a great operation of doing just that.  They offer an airport pick-up or drop-off depending on what is needed and breakfast as well.  The rooms are comfortably appointed in a very basic way with no exterior windows.  There is also very little privacy because of the interior windows but it is always quiet.
40,"I stayed one night after flying in to Guatemala late at night, and flying out again the following afternoon. The free airport pickup and drop off is a great service and I found it definitely worth paying a bit more to stay in this hostel as opposed to others which did not offer this service. The people running the hostel are nice, my room was nice, breakfast is basic - fruit, toast and tea/coffee. There is not much to see in the surrounding area and for safety reasons I do not recommend walking to the city centre from this hostel, but for an airport stopover it's perfect."
50,The Hotel Biltmore in Guatemala City is Fabulous!!!! The room we have is immaculate!!!  Very clean and very large!!! The AC worked perfectly!!!  The rainfall shower makes you want to stay there for a long long time.  No low flow water there!!!  The waitstaff is superb and very helpful.  The entire property is very clean.  You must not miss the breakfast buffet!!! Fresh juices and fruits along with the regular breakfast items. No continual breakfast here!!!!  
40,"Very clean, modern hotel. Great bilingual staff. Very helpful at bridging communication gaps and tourist tips. I didn’t give a 5-star only because they need to upgrade their breakfast buffet food options. Pretty much the same thing everyday and the food isn’t kept warm. "
40,"I found the breakfast to be most helpful and friendly, in particular Jefferson who always went out of this way to be hospitable, accommodating and to go the extra mile without asking.   Unfortunately, when checking in the reception staff told me I was welcome to use the larger and better gym next door in the connecting Camino Real hotel, which I did so. However, I was then given a bill for almost $50 for just four short visits to the gym! I was never told that it would be charged. This left a sour taste, on what was a mostly pleasant stay. In the end the reception staff offered to split the gym bill in half with me, not ideal or fair to be honest. Nonetheless, the kitchen staff deserve some credit."
50,"went on a road show for work and stayed at the Biltmore and had an amazing time. rooms were super clean, everyone was so helpful, accommodating and friendly.  The hotel is near malls, restaurants and entertainment places so it was easy to walk to.Will definitely book again."
40,Tough area to move around freely other than the couple of blocks with large expensive hotels and restaurants. Good for one night but the traffic makes it very difficult as a long stay. No complaints of hotel very friendly helpful and super breakfast
50,"We stayed twice at this hotel, we arrived late at night and the shuttle was there to meet us the hotel is not far from the airport. We had a nice room clean and comfortable with very good Internet access. The breakfast was very good you get a full breakfast included in the very reasonable price. The restaurant is very nice the staff were always attentive . We had dinner there on two nights, the only draw back is that it does not have a drink license . We were able to walk to the museum, the avenue Reforma has a walk way in the center. The staff remembered us when we returned and said welcome back. There is a bank very near, to change money and an ATM .would recommend this hotel, to visitors to Guatemala city."
50,Hotel arranged pick up from Guate airport. Hotel in the centre of town easy walking distance from museums. large very comfortable room with huge bathroom and endless hot water. All staff at hotel very freindly and helpfull. Price included an incredibly good breakfast. Check hotel macaws on second floor terrace. Overall very highly recommended at fantastic price.
40,"I have stayed at HG's in the USA, Mexico and now Guatemala, and this is by far my favorite property. I choose to stay here for it's proximity to the Mexican Embassy, which I was visiting to prepare my paperwork for my work visa. It was absolutely gorgeous! The value for the price was excellent. It was in a safe area, and the receptionist, Caesar, was so helpful. At the moment of my appointment in the embassy it began to downpour and he lent me his personal umbrella so I could get there on time. Very much appreciated!!! He also arranged for a wake up call for me, and a shuttle to the bus station since I was traveling on Galgos, not by airplane. The morning staff was equally friendly, and the breakfast was excellent. It was a limited cooked to order menu, but much better than a"
40,Stayed here our first night in Guatemala City.  The shuttle driver was waiting at the airport and got us to the hotel very quickly!  The room was nice with good shower pressure and in room wifi and tv.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  Good experience for the price :)  We left too early to get the breakfast.
40,"I was staying at the Holiday Inn and due to some scheduling errors they bumped me out and I had to find another place to lay my head.  Most every hotel was booked for some convention, but Cesar over at the Howard Johnson hooked it up.  He spoke great English and humored me with my high school spanish.  I was so excited about finding a place to stay that was more like a family owned operation.  The staff was extremely friendly and somehow could understand my broken spanish.    Highlights: Beautiful tile everywhere Wifi friendly staff, called me by name (not the bad ones most people that know me use) Good breakfast Huge room Airport shuttle Small gym  Lowlights:  The couches in the room were a little worn out Beds firm/hard no desk  I'm a fan of the HoJo!"
50,"I had a pleasant stay. Beautiful hotel, good service, big room, huge TV screen, comfortable bed. All the best restaurants are in s walking distance. I could hear the planes taking off from the nearby airport, but it didn't bother me really."
40,Stayed here night before departing from Guatemala Airport. This is a brand new hotel so everything is shinny and clean. Large comfortable rooms with big flat screen TVs. Many restaurants nearby within walking distance. Free shuttle service to airport too! 
50,"Whether you are going to Guatemala City for work or pleasure the Courtyard Marriott is the place to be.   This hotel provides ease of access to various malls and tourist destinations as well as friendly staff who speak English and Spanish.   This hotel is standard featuring the same amenities that all Courtyards offer. You can find WiFi, the standard medium firm Marriott bed, hot water and a great breakfast. You will find the underground parking to be a breeze.   Pay close attention to the Volcano in the background as you make your way up the elevator. The view is astounding. "
40,"Lovely hotel and beautiful room. Service is really goo. Food is great and lovely people. Would recommend staying here.  Hotel looks new, and stayed after a long journey to get here, nice furniture and great experience."
10,"I had a gift card for more than half the cost of my room, and I only purchased this room with the intent of using it. I told the staff upon check-in, and was told that I should have used it as my payment method when reserving the room. However, that is impossible, and the terms and conditions state that the card is to be used at the front desk. I explained that, sent them the email with all of my gift card information, and sent them a photo of my gift card balance as well. They told me that someone would call the room or come up. No one did.  Later that night, we spoke with two other people at the front desk and they gave us the same answer—that they would make some calls and contact us in our room. They never did.  In the morning upon checkout, we spoke with yet another person,"
40,"This place is so friendly! The owners picked us up from the airport and helped us plan our trip from here. The rooms are basic, but very clean. It is so close to the airport, you get a good breakfast and a kind welcome to Guatemala."
50,"My wife and I went on a 1000km tour through Guatemala and Honduras and ended up our trip at the Hostal Los Lagos. We arrived hungry so the owner ordered a pizza for us. We had an early flight and the owner drove us to the airport for free (well, the ride is included in the room price). Breakfast is also included in the price. Our room had private shower & hot water. The room was basic, but had TV and a large, comfy bed. Overall a good value & experience. What I liked the most: the owners are friendly and will do everything to make your stay pleasant."
50,"Had a very pleasant surprise during a stop in Guatemala City. Found by chance a little B&B located 5 minutes away (easy walk) from the airport. Luis and his spanish wife Mariloly will do everything to make yourself comfortable. I was able to check in around 9.30 am after a red eye flight from Los Angeles. The place is fairly basic (although there is a TV in every room) but very clean. Great breakfast and fabulous coffee too.  No need to go to the unsafe downtown area (and overpay your taxi ride) or to get charged for your hotel room over $100 (especially in a country like Guatemala for God's sake). At Los Lagos, you will pay $15 or $20 (including breakfast) depending on the room. By the way, 5 and 6 have been recently remodeled. Their address: 8 ave. 18-85 zona 13 Aurora 1,"
50,"We are a couple with an adult daughter. We stayed for 5 days in duplex suite on top floor in Guatemala city. It was perfect for our needs where we stayed together with privacy. The staff in all areas were very friendly, smiley and helped when necessary. We had breakfast with our room and also premium club facilities. We thoroughly all of of them. Breakfast was fantastic, had all the options one would want.  We used the hotel taxi service to visit Lake Atlitan, Antigua, Chichicastenango, Pacaya volcano among others. They are very reliable and hotel had fixed prices, thank you Mario for making our trip memorable.  We booked directly on the web site, it had best price. Airport transfer to and from was included along with breakfast for three of us. We are seasoned travelers and we"
50,"This is my go to hotel when in guatemala city, I've been staying here for the past 8 years and always very satisfied, friendly staff, always very helpful, I would not choose any other hotel to stay in, so tha k you for making me feel welcome all the time barcelo!  Happy new year 2020, and I will see you again later this year. "
50,"comfortable spacious and clean room with great bed, shower, bath tub. perfect tv screen and fast wifi friendly staff, no noise. options for buffet breafast or a la carte. other restaurants and malls in walking distance of the hotel, safe neighbourhood"
50,"Me gustaria tener una nueva experiencia en este excelente hotel en la cuidad capital de Guatemala. I would love to stay in this amazing hotel, has great service, excellent food and also would recommend it to anyone.  "
10,"We made a reservation and asked the front desk lady if we would have access to Premium Level, she said YES for the rate she gave us. When we got to the hotel, they said I needed to pay $62 extra to access to the premium level. I explained to the supervisor that the other employee had said that this was included in our reservation, but she was very rude and uneducated and said ""you either pay, or leave"", we paid it because I did not want to ruin our vacation. I then contacted the director Larry Robles, and he was basically ""yeah sorry the receptionist lied to you, not my fault, no refunds"". They will do whatever they can to steal your money, they charge you for anything, even for water when you're having breakfast. Guatemala is warm, so they charge you $2 for a 500ml water"
50,"Recently stayed one night at Hostal Villa Toscana. Arrived around mid night so the free pick up was not part of the deal. The hotel arranged the airport pick up for US$10 (given it is only 5 minutes drive around the corner it seems expensive). However, the driver was super friendly and cheerful. Nice to be greeted after a long flight and be in safe hands in the busy arrival hall!   The hotel is in a gated area so it is safe. The room was clean and quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Receptionist spoke good English (breakfast room staff did not speak English). Outdoor breakfast room in the garden was lovely! Most of the items in the breakfast menu were unavailable (pancake, yogurt, banana etc), Only thing available was the Guatemalan breakfast but it was tasty.  Great stop"
50,"Absolutely great for an overnight from the airport.  The room was small but perfect.  The host couldn.t have been nicer, even proving an unanticipated snack when I left at 6 am .  Would gladly stay there again."
50,"We stayed here because of other reviews and price. This is a nice little place, service is great and the free shuttle to the airport was about 2-3 mins. The only thing that was disappointing was there was hot water for the shower. Other than that you won't be disappointed. "
10,I've been all over the world and stayed in some horrific places but I've never been more disappointed with a hotel than I was with this one. We expected a comfortable place to sleep and get dinner but the level of service we received was horrific from check in until check out.  This hotel is recommended by one of the authors on the forum - to the extent that I imagine she has shares in the place and as she gushed about it I thought it would be OK - I was very wrong.  Check in was brusque and unpleasant as the receptionist was more concerned about getting our money than anything else. The hotel had no lift and as the reptionist had a 'sore back' we had to lug our bags through the garage and up three flights of stairs ourselves.  The room was pleasant but the next issue was with
40,"We stayed here twice, when we first arrived in Guatemala and again on our last night.  It is minutes from the airport.  They will arrange for transportation to or from the hotel, which is included in the price of the hotel stay.  It is a quite, clean hotel. It has a pretty little courtyard.  I would definitely stay here again."
40,"I visited for 2 nights in May 2014.  The owners are very friendly and spoke good English. They also provide a free pick-up service from the airport (which is 5 minutes drive away) which is very convenient for those like me that had travelled a long distance.  My room was clean and tidy and the bathroom (which was a few metres away) was also very well kept.  Breakfast was nice with fresh coffee, toast and fruit (melon and mango) provided.  I paid $17 a night which in my opinion is great value."
40,"I stayed at Patricia's Bed and Breakfast one night on my way to Xela.  My flight arrived late and Patricia's English fluent son was there waiting for me at the airport.  There was absolutely zero hassle.  He picked me up, took me directly to the hotel which was quaint and perfectly prepared.  The rooms are small but plenty comfortable.  They had fresh water available for me in my room.  The breakfast the following morning was nice.  They then helped me book and took me directly to a bus to Xela.  I will definitely stay here again when I need a one night stop in Guatemala City."
40,"This is a really nice little guest house located literally at the airport, which is great if you have an early morning flight.  We arrived quite late but they were expecting us and made us feel very welcome.  The room was small but for an overnight stay it was fine.  Very clean and they had a lovely yard to sit in.  We didn't have a chance to enjoy her breakfast because we had to leave at 5:00 AM but they had a tray with  juice and cookies set out for us.  Would definitely stay again if had to stay near airport for early flight."
50,"My boyfriend and I used Patricia's when we had to be in Guatemala City to pick up visiting friends and family. The staff at Patricia's was wonderful, meeting us at the airport and bringing us right back. They recommended places to eat nearby (a wonderful comedor a few blocks away had the best watermelon juice), and when we told them we were meeting up with a friend to go downtown guatemala city, they offered us rides and drove us to the bus terminal (we wanted to experience the public transportation) for practically nothing. We had to leave by 5 am and they had a light breakfast waiting for us. It was a really familial and comfortable place. We already have plans of staying there again!"
50,"Patricia is one of most sweet souvenirs of our trip to Guatemala and Belize. She comes to pick you up at the airport when you need (even at 4.00 a.m....!) and she drives safely and prudently in the streets of Ciudad de Guatemala. Her b&b is very familiar, there is a beautiful woman that cooks you a great and typical breakfast and there is Patricia's son that calls a pizza for you if you ate too much tortillas. The rooms are essential, there is everything you need, and there are a lot of nice people to meet in the big common table. We went there the first time in 2009 and it is sure, if we go back again in Guatemala City, we go to stay to Patricia's."
50,"I stayed in most 5 star hotels here for business but biltmore although not 5 star was exceptional and kind with their staff and services, would definitely recommend, it also connects with Westin Camino so you can also use their facilities and overall pay less. "
30,"First time with this hotel.  The hotel is linked to the Westin and you can access it via your key card .  The restaurant only have a breakfast area and no other restaurants for lunch and dinner, so you do need access to Westin if you intend to have dinner at the hotel ( the other option is room service).  The staff however makes the stay comfortable as they are very friendly and helpful. "
40,Not a luxury hotel like the Westin next door but certainly upscale and very comfortable. And there is a passageway to the Westin if you want a meal or a drink without having to go outside. It is generally fairly quiet but once in awhile a jet will fly overhead. The room gets stuffy without the fan on but fan is a little noisy and makes the room too cold. Breakfast buffet is more than adequate. My chief complaint is the shower - it is dangerously slippery. Someone could easily slip and injure themselves. Fortunately I had a pair of flip flops which I wore in the shower. But I suggest putting a rubber mat in the shower or texturing the shower floor surface.
40,"Connected to the Westin Camino Real, the Biltmore is a boutique hotel. Centrally located in Zona 10, you can walk the streets during the day safely, with restaurants close by.  The rooms are large, the bathroom has a good setup although the water pressure is too strong. There is an independent wifi router in each room, so connectivity is great, and an independent minisplit air conditioning with is also good. Very reasonably priced. The breakfast wasn't that varied but was ok. The room service prices are expensive.  The gym is only a cardio room with a bike, elliptical and threadmill. Rooms facing the streat can be noisy, especially since there are bars and restaurant on that side. Overall, a good business hotel."
30,"I was attending a conference next door at the Westin, which is attached to the Biltmore. My room was fine, if a little dated. Staff was friendly and the included breakfast was a little limited for me as I need gluten free. The location is right off a main road and a short walk to restaurants and stores. "
50,"Recently opened hotel in the heart of Zona 10. Great rooms, service and staff. Might benefit from training the bar and restaurant a bit more. It has to do with being quicker, but I do have to keep in mind that service might be slower outside the US. Totally recommend this location."
40,"We stayed three nights at the Courtyard at the end of our trip to Guatemala.  The hotel is fairly new and the room was good (upgraded at check-in).  The service at the desk at check in/out was very good and professional.  Some comments:  We had breakfast 3 times and although the hot foods changed a little each day, there were the same 3 fruits served each day (cantaloupe, watermelon and pineapple).  In a country with such a wide variety of fruit, it would have been nice to have them offer different fruit daily.  The opportunity to order eggs, cooked to order is a nice touch.  The service at the restaurant is very good.  We caught the shuttle to the airport at 10pm.  We had our bags stored when we checked out and came back later in the evening for the shuttle ride.  The front"
30,"The hotel was okay, in general, the gym descent, but, according to the reception people, they had stolen the scale! Most of us go to the gym to lose some pounds and keep our shape. Please buy a $15 scale and put it in the gym. It will make a world of a difference. It is just a simple thing, and since I requested, it never happened. Take care of those details and you will have an edge over other places. Also, they don't handle smoked salmon. I have a diet based on smoked salmon (lox), such a simple product you can buy it at Paiz. No, never happened. The devil is in the details..."
40,"Stayed here for one night at both the beginning and end of our trip to Guatemala for airport ease.  The hotel was fine-clean, quiet, as you would expect for a Marriott.  We ha arranged for the hotel shuttle to pick us up at the airport upon arrival from Flores, and the shuttle didn't show.  Luckily we were able to hitch a ride with the Radisson shuttle.  We ate a late dinner at the restaurant in the lobby, and it was very good."
50,"Hotel was modern, new, and clean. The food was super tasty. Clearly they have an excellent chef. The breakfast was far better than any Courtyard in the US, with local specialties. We had to grab dinner there late one night and the dinner food was excellent!! Highly recommend the restaurant. "
40,"Its a little difficult to find if arriving by car as the hotel rooms are above a small shopping center and the reception area is only one of the 'store-fronts'. However, the rooms are nicely appointed and the 'free breakfast' was delicious and professionally served. The airport shuttle service for our friends who were departing back to the States was timely and efficient."
50,"I flew into Guatemala City apprehensively, at the start of my motorcycle trip from Guatemala to Argentina. To my pleasant surprise I was met at the airport by the Howard Johnson driver with my name on a card.which I hadn't even requested. He took me to this wonderfull hotel, conveniently located for the airport and also for the city itself. There followed a very relaxed stay in a good standard hotel, beautifully furnished and with friendly, efficient and helpfull staff. Breakfast was a delight in their busy restaurant with plenty of local business people also dining, which speaks for itself. This is a great little hotel and I highly recommend it."
50,"First of I would like to thank Ceasar Rojas (manger) he personally picked my wife and I from airport (they provide a shuttle service to and from at no extra cost) he was very pleasant to talk to, and cominucated very well in English! Once arrived at the hotel we couldn't belive how beautiful it is definitely a 5 star experience!!  Every morning we were given purified water bottles (complementary), and a excellent breakfast; Steven one of the waiters that took care of us every morning was very helpful and friendly along side the others that work in the resturant.  Over all I have to say this HoJo is by far the best experience I have had!! Rooms are always clean, staff bends over backwards to make your stay the best!  THANKS TO ALL!!!  The Espana Family "
40,"As our flight into Guatemala arrived at 10:00 p.m., we just needed a simple and close hotel to stay at before our 6:00 a.m. flight to Flores the following morning. We also wanted something reliable. The hotel also provided complimentary transportation to and from the airport, which was a big plus for us.   The room was small, but clean and quaint. The front desk was helpful (no problem with the wakeup call) and we were given a complimentary bottle of bottle of water (the only hotel during our entire trip that did that), which we used to brush our teeth and for some drinking. We could have paid less at another hotel. but we wanted to start our trip on the right foot and this hotel gave us that."
40,We stayed here on two occasions on our recent trip to Guatemala because it is only 10 minutes from the airport.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable.  The attached restaurant was excellent.  On first arrival we were suprised by finding armed security guards (shotguns) stationed at the entrance but this common place throught the city.  Staff were very accommodating and professional.
50,"I was getting in late on a Friday night, so I was looking for something close to the airport as this was my first trip to Guatemala.  Toscana was very nice, very affordable, and is a beautiful little property.  Room was fine, especially if you are used to European hotels.  Bathroom was very nice with plenty of hot water.  The location itself was very safe, as first you had to go through a manned gate to get into the neighborhood, and then Toscana itself had off-street parking, safe rooms, etc.  Breakfast was included in the price, and you got to choose from maybe eight or so different offerings.  Breakfast is probably the best part, as it's in a beautiful courtyard they have, just a stunning little outdoor area."
40,"Small but very tranquille hotel. Only 2 minutes away from the entrance of the airport, shuttle service is included in the price. No bothers about traffic jams, which can be hell in Guatemala City and cause unnecessary stress. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. We arrived late and it was wonderful that we could still order sometime to eat and a bottle of wine. Good price quality range."
50,"This is a very nice and friendly place to stay in Guatemala city which is literally just round the corner from the airport. They will come and pick you up in a car and take you to the hotel. Sergio is especially helpful and speaks very good English also. They can arrange onward travel, taxis, food and provide recommendations for trips. The fascinating anthropology museum is close by as is the museum of modern art although i didn't have time to visit that one. You can even walk to the museums if you are feeling adventurous."
40,Nice B&B just about three blocks from the airport. Small but cozy and very budget friendly. Had a large group occupying the entire hotel (21 people) for one night before we headed out of the city. Very enjoyable.
50,Great location 3 minutes from airport and 5 minutes from mall. Staff was super accommodating. Cab fare to & from airport included in room cost. Breakfast included also. Sergio made arrangements for an additional cab ride to mall & back. We had our dinner brought in and ate out on the patio terrace...so lovely. Staff was amazing!
50,Arrived late at night at the airport. Staff was there to pick me up!! Only 5 min. drive in very safe gated neighbourhodd!! Staff speak english and rooms are very spacious and clean!!! Breakfast included. Very fast wireless internet!!!
50,"I've stayed at Patricia's Bed and Breakfast twice, on coming and going from Guatemala City. They are located in a very safe gated community. Upon arriving, they ask if you are hungry and give you a notebook of restaurants that deliver, and will order for you. I speak a little Spanish, but English is o.k. too, and I am more comfortable with it, so talking to someone who speaks fluent English is a definite plus. Their free pick up and drop off service to the airport adds a big value to the already inexpensive stay. I don't need anything fancy, especially when I'm coming in late and leaving early, so Patricia's it the perfect budget fit for me. Also they seen to be a really caring family and gave friendly helpful advice and service. Its very clean."
50,Having recently stayed at Patricia's hotel after losing my passport it was exactly what I needed in every way a lovely Guatemalan family run this hotel they a sooo friendly helpful and are happy to help you with anything you need they make everything easy for you and go out of there way to give you the best service possible  they b&b is located right near the airport in a secure gated compound and they offer transfers around the city too breakfast is decent fruit toast coffee etc the rooms are b&b standard comfortable and clean   Thanks for an awesome stay
30,Upon leaving Patricia's Bed and Breakfast be sure to confirm the price of transportation when payment has to be made at the other end.  The price from Guatemala City to San Pedro La Laguna is 125 quetzales NOT 250 Quetzales !!!!  I spoke with this owner and he told me that he had actually quoted $30.00 which he certainly did not.  I use Quetzales not US dollars.
40,"Patricia's is located in a very secure, quiet neighborhood close to the airport. The staff is incredibly friendly and willing to help you with any questions/problems. They offer a shuttle service to and from the airport and/or bus stations. Rooms are nothing fancy, but very comfortable."
50,"I'm still here thru 1/1 at 11:55pm. This is a beautiful hotel with comfortable beds, hot water with great shower pressure. The staff is so helpful and polite, they get the nuances right. I'm a new fan of chain Barcelo. If I had to find some things that I am not a fan of, here they are. (Still, I give this hotel five stars.) I can't say that I am a fan of the quality of the conditioner because it dries out my hair. The gym has everything I need, so I am happy. Equipment is a bit old, so I am nursing a few bruises from maneuvering myself in and out of the leg equipment. I use the USB from the TV because they don't have a USB port. I have a very comfortable bed, a balcony, coffee maker and great view. They also give me 2 bottles of water each day. I am very comfortable here and"
30,"I can remember staying at this hotel when it was a Marriott in 2005.  Barcelo has since bought this hotel and made no visible improvements, allowing the rooms and pool area to decline in quality.  Like other Latin American Barcelos where I have stayed, this one appears poorly maintained. First the room...it was comfortable but the bed provided only mushy, very soft pillows not good for sleeping. The bathroom floor showed poor quality caulking between the individual tiles and the sink drain did not function; I had to pull out the drain plug so it would drain. The room windows have not been washed for many years and the air conditioning unit is operated by an older, non-digital thermostat with two functioning fan settings—high and low—as the medium setting does not work.  The room"
50,"You feel very safe from the moment you arrive here. The guards have to open the sliding front gate. At the front doors, by the elevators and in other locations are suited gentlemen. The venue was hosting weddings over the weekend. We had our breakfasts in Strikers. There were several English language tv stations, The shower had terrific pressure. There is a very nice jade store in the hotel. you can but a bracelet for $11 or a lavender jade necklace for $600. You need your key to access the elevator and the pool."
50,We had a very nice stay at the Barcelo the steam room and the sauna were a great addition!  The hotel is very well maintained in a great location of the city.  The pool is heated and very nice.  We had a balcony room that overlooked the city.
50,"We stayed at The Barcelona for one week. We enjoyed our stay because the property was safe and extremely clean. It was also really beautiful and the staff was always very friendly and accommodating. If the person I talked with didn’t understand my request, they would find someone who did. The room was really nice, comfortable, clean and quiet, and the view was great!  The pool was huge and beautiful and we enjoyed eating at Strikers that also served great drinks! We stayed there because of the close proximity to the airport. "
50,"I have stayed in a few hotels on my visits to Guatemala. Howard Johnson in Guate, City has been the absolute BEST!!! This hotel has every amenity you could imagine. The free breakfast is at Geneva  Coffee house which is on sight and it is amazing. A FULL breakfast that you chose off they menu. They do not have refrigerators in the room that was the ONLY disappointment I found! Their staff was AMAZING as well!!! Just booked another room for my visit in June!!!"
50,"We are five hours by bus from Guatemala City and needed a place to stay overnight before meeting a relative who was flying in from the states the next day.  After reading the reviews on the Howard Johnson Inn, we decided to give it a try.  The staff was exceptional in every way, from the manager, who spoke perfect English and was so kind and helpful, to the driver of the courtesy van who took us to the airport and waited patiently for our sister to arrive, to the maid who graciously brought us extra pillows.  With a free courtesy van to the airport and later the bus station, an excellent free breakfast with full choice of the menu, and a clean, comfortable room, we felt we got much more than our money's worth."
30,"The was hotel was great. But, the restuarnt was so, slow."
40,"We had to go to the City (Guatemala City) to do some medical tests and visit the American Embassy. We found the Howard Johnson Hotel was in close proximity to both and had a restaurant on the premises. Being non too comfortable in the City due to the current advisories offered to travelers to Guatemala we wanted to stay at a hotel where we did not have to go out if we wanted to grab a bite of food etc. Since this stay was our first in the City and was not for shopping or fun but for fairly unappealing reasons, we didn't want to have to worry about being in a dangerous part of the city as well. The Howard Johnson was just right, actually across the street from the US Embassy and only 4 blocks from the major medical centers and labs. We also found that the restaurant was pleasant"
40,We stayed here on the last night of our journey to catch an early morning flight back on Continental via Houston.  The hotel has a complimentary shuttle to the airport but you'll have to let the front desk know.  The rooms have everything you'd expect and the connecting restaurant serves excellent food.  We arrived early (6 AM) having taken the overnight bus from Flores/Santa Elena to GC and hopped on a cab to the Howard Johnson.  They let us check-in immediately but then phoned to say they'd charge us but later decided they'd waive the charge (I'm not sure if this usual but I think it was the manager who decided to waive it after he saw us).  Breakfast is complimentary and very delicious!  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay near the airport.
50,"I highly recommend!  5 min from Guatemala City International airport.  Has a partnership with the hotel next door so, unlimited amenities and restaurants.  Rooms are very clean and modern.  Breakfast is included and delicious."
30,The Biltmore is fairly pretentious with modern facilities but it is flawed is several ways.  You can get lost in the maze of passageways as there are no signs indicating where the lobby is. The rooms are clean and modern but the door safety locks do not work and the shower door does not keep the water in and you will soon have a slippery wet bathroom . They do not have coffee available for early morning risers.
40,"I’ve been traveling to 2-3x a year to Guatemala for work and staying at the Biltmore for 4 years now, it’s about time a gave a review.  It’s the less expensive sister hotel to the Westin Camino Real, which it is physically connected to.   For my needs, it meets all the key points. Rooms are simple, modern, no frills, comfortable.   The internet just works and is fast. Each room has it’s own WiFi router and no limit to # of devices or special codes or proprietary authorization system to access it.   There’s a decent breakfast included - certainly adequate to get you through the morning!  Picky people will surely find a reason to criticize it.   There’s a shuttle to pick you up at the airport, and a return shuttle that leaves every 30min. Let them know ahead of time when you"
50,Room is spacious and comfortable.  Bed feels like sleeping on a cloud!  Excellent breakfast!  Afternoon tea/coffee with pastries included.  Well located.  Beautiful for walking.  Shops restaurants located all around hotel.  Friendly staff.
40,"I stayed here for 2 weeks. I was with a volunteer group. The hotel was very clean, had good air conditioning and a great breakfast buffet. The staff was always very friendly and helpful.  We had a strange timer go off on the phone in our bathroom the first night we were there. After 3 attempts/calls to the front desk to have it stop we pulled it off the wall. Someone was sent to turn it off but decided it was the hair dryer making noise. It was just a bit frustrating because we were very tired from taking the red eye to Guatemala and then working.  The air conditioning smelled musty/moldy.  The water in the shower was luke warm at best.  There is no fan in the bathroom. When you take a shower, the bathroom gets very warm and humid."
50,We stayed here for three days in two rooms and had a great time. The hotel was very quiet at night even with groups staying there and had an excellent breakfast in the morning which was about $10 USD per person and well worth it. The shuttle service from the airport was excellent and is only about 5kms away so just depends on the time of day for how long it will take.   It is located in a great part of town with many restaurants close by and the very impressive Oakland Mall is only about a 15 minute walk away. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
40,"I am very pleased that I stayed at this new hotel. My 2 nights stay was simply wonderful. EVen the towels smell very nice. My room was cleaned twice during my two days stay and the coffee and tea facility was replenished daily. On my last day they were even giving away cotton candy in the lobby for guests.  The area is in District 10 surrounded by other hotels and good restaurants. My airport shuttle was prompt and within 10 min I was in airport.Would highly recommend and would stay again if ever I go back to Guatemala.  PS,. Lobby is on the 3rd floor, my wifi was free and the room has a bath tub and I even have a balcony overlooking the patio cafe on the ground floor.  They have currency exchange but unfortunately only for American dollars and since I was carrying Canadian $"
50,"The restaurant here has always been one of my favorites during my business visits to Guatemala. For the first time I stayed at the hotel as well, and it was great! The restaurant staff exceeds all expectations, specially waiter Jose Sanchez, who will go all in to serve you!!!"
50,"I can highly recommend the Courtyard by Mariott in Guatemala City, we stayed for a couple of nights in 2017, the hotel withstood the earthquake of 7.4 that occurred whilst we stayed!! With no damage, quite a surreal expereince, we were staying on the top floor also. Staff were fantastic following the event. Lovely interior, rooms are large and spacious and totally modern, very comfortable. Would stay here again. Felt completely safe also, which is good."
50,"We chose this hotel to stay on our last night for a few reasons.  Number one it's 10 minutes to the airport, number two they have a free shuttle starting at 4:15 am every hour and three it's a Marriot and we knew it would be comfortable and clean.  I will say even we were on the 9th floor overlooking the Main Street we still could hear the music from the disco across the street till 2 AM.  Granted it was a Saturday night...It wasn't crazy loud but just a thump thump in the background.  If you are staying on a weekend night request a room higher up.  Oh another thing...we were taking the 5:15 shuttle to the airport having woken up a half hour earlier and while we were waiting to climb on the man in charge brought us delicious coffee.  Now, that is service."
40,"I've been here twice now! Cheap, clean (!) and safe accomodation for Guatemala City. Perfect place for a stopover (I was just traveling through). English and spanish speaking. They'll pick you up at the airport and get you back again.  Nothing much to do there really. But wifi, comfortable beds and a little garden is very welcomming, so is the family! Would definently stay there agian! Contactinfo: info@patriciashotel.com"
40,"My friend and I spent spring break studying Spanish in Guatemala.  Celas Maya, a Spanish School in Xela arranged transportation to and from the Guatemala City Airport and lodging at Patricia's B&B.  Both Alberto and Patricia were waiting for us at the airport when we arrived from the States and quickly whisked us away to their gated middle  class neighborhood and their pleasant B&B.  Our room was small and clean.  The shared bathroom had a hot shower.  The colorful garden/patio area was a quiet, shady refuge, a perfect place to relax.  Breakfast was coffee, fresh fruit and toast shared family style on the patio.  The B&B is close to the airport so every now and then you can hear a jet whoosh overhead.  If you are a light sleeper, you might want to bring earplugs, although the"
40,"I was traveling from the airport in Guatemala City by bus to Xela, Guatemala, to attend a Spanish school. My school had arranged transportation through Patricia's to get me from the airport to the bus station. However, my plane was delayed, and I was too late to take the bus that day. Patricia was very helpful because she came to pick me up at the airport, even though it was later than expected. Since I couldn't leave that day, she brought me to the bed and breakfast until I could leave the next day. I really appreciated the wireless internet so I could contact my host family, school, and family back in the U.S."
30,"Patricia's Guest House - B&B was mentioned in Lonely Planet.  There was no website, so we were a little worried about making a reservation, but were in a pinch.  The staff was SUPER friendly and very accommodating.  We flew in from Flores to the TAG hanger and they picked us up there (15Q) and waited for what seemed like forever as the TAG employees tried to find the bags we'd left in storage before our flight to Flores... this is after a 1.5 hr delay in the plane.  We felt bad, but the brothers (?) were patient and helpful.  The home is in a gated community.  I think they said they have 5 rooms for rent, with shared bathrooms (2 were in our hall... ours and one other, and we shared one bathroom).  They had both double beds and twins (we stayed in 2 twins) available.  The sheets"
40,"I stayed at Patricia's when arriving in Guat City at 11pm.  They made it very easy.  First of all, they speak English, which makes it much easier for someone like myself who speaks broken Spanish to feel confident and comfortable that everything is arranged.  They met us at the airport and took us straight to the B&B which is just a couple of minutes away.    The room was clean, but very spartan.  No problem, that was all I needed. The pretty garden patio where we sat for breakfast was very charming, and breakfast was tasty.  Be aware that you are right by the airport.  Planes will be flying over.  I was too tired to really notice, but it is worth knowing.   In the morning Alberto took us to the bus station, after checking on bus times for us.  The hosts were so helpful and"
40,"We have stayed at the Barcelo sever times in our travels through Guatemala.  The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are neat, the swimming pool is great and the breakfast delicious.  Certainly a place to stay."
50,"We run Mission groups through here multiple times a year and are never disappointed. No matter how big or small our teams are they take care of us in everyday possible. The shuttles run very timely the food is always guaranteed to please, breakfast is to die for ! "
50,"Excellent quality hotel, centrally located.  It provided the base for a city stay and a courtesy bus to the airport.  It offered more than we had time to do eg the pool and gym.  We did not use the room service. The Japanese restaurant was very good but the breakfast a little disappointing for the cost."
30,"The airport is a 5-10 min ride. Check in was fast but impersonal bordering on rude. The hotel is elegant but the furnishings are dated. AC and WiFi were outstanding, as was the shower pressure. The meeting venue was great with great food and service. Great food and service in the restaurant for the buffet breakfast."
20,I have stayed prevoiusly at this hotel and was impressed. This visit it was lacking in a few areas. 1) They did not have a crib.  Its a large family hotel... why no crib? 2) I am a Expedia gold member and was entitled to a few upgrades... and welcoming drinks... didnt happen until I asked.  3)But what caused me to write this review was the woman running the privelege lounge on the 9th floor. Deliberatly avoided eye contact and when we had to find her in the kitchenette... asked for a beer.... she glared and behaved like we had insulted her.   It was so rude.... I had to give a poor review.  On the brightside. rooms were clean. Breakfast and the breakfast staff.... great. Also at the piano bar... A1.  
30,"I would only ask the owners of this place to use the bathroom and also try to take a shower in and of the two rooms I stayed at. Secondly, I would love to read their reviews which pretty much would say that there is not enough room for an average size person, unless they were designed for ten year olds..."
50,Awesome time and room here in Guatemala. One spent on night here but it was amazing. We had a great pancake breakfast the only thing I would suggest is maybe a not so firm materess. I would highly recommend this place to anyone needing to crash! SAFE SAFE SAFE SAFE!!
50,"I travel to Guatemala regularly and am in need of a one or two night which makes for easy access to the La Aurora intl airport.   Villa Toscana is in a gated urbanization called La Aurora, and is literally walking distance from arrivals and departures.   Yet, because it is gated w security safety is great and the area lends itself to early morning runs or walks along the perimeter of the airport.  the accommodations are really nice.   i have been to two other hotels in the urbanization and this is by far the best.   Attentive staff.  Good reliable taxi service.   Free airport pick up and breakfast.    nice common space in dining area, garden and terrace.   For this kind of travel need it works great!"
50,"I was traveling with a girlfriend of mine. We arrived at the hotel after 1030pm due to a delayed flight. The staff was responsive to our delay and adjusted our pick-up from the airport (HIGHLY recommended). You get a discount for paying in USD. We were given a plug-in bug repellent which was a nice surprise (didn't notice any bugs, so even better!). We didn't try the shower, but there was dry shampoo and soap provided. Clean towels and sheets. We left early the next morning before breakfast started, but were still provided us with a granola bar, bananas, and a yogurt drink before we left. The atmosphere was beautiful with character and we felt very safe. Location is super convenient from the airport - it was a very short drive away (10 min max).  Note: I'm not sure if there was"
30,"The true character of the staff shows when there is a problem and how it is handled.  The staff (Sergio) was wonderful.  A mistake had been made but he bent over backwards to accommodate me and apologized profusely.  I have no complaints in that regard.  Very, very kind man.    However, the rooms are nothing special.  Yes, they are clean and cozy, but it was hot, I had to open windows and it was noisy.  Also no hot water.    It is very close to the airport and I felt safe here.  "
50,"We stayed at HOJO Guatemala 2 years ago and it was an awesome experience. While planning this trip, i wanted a hotel closer to my husband family at zona 1. Everything i looked at was way out of our price range. Decided on hojo again. We got the family suite with 4 queen size beds. The room was kept really clean, bathroom spotless. Every day we got our rooms cleaned and the sheets were changed everyday, trust me i checked. The only 2 complaints i have about this hotel is there was no minifridge/microwave and that the elevator is way to small.  The staff is great, specially Cesar at the front desk. Helpful,courteous, friendly and a very nice gentleman. He is just the nicest!! The Restaurtant is great, everything we ate there was awesome and did not make us sick at all. We actually"
40,"I stay at this hotel every time i visit Guatemala, the shuttle service is very convenient since they pick and drop you at the airport, plus they even pick me up and drop me off at a bus terminal when i have to go to other city, for free. It's very clean and confy, the rooms have a/c with remote, very good hard beds (i hate soft beds, make my back hurt and instead of relaxing i get more stressed), all the rooms i've stayed at have LCD Tvs and cable. The breakfast is complementary but could be better if were a buffet, instead they give you a menu to pick what you want from eggs, cereals, fruit salads or pancakes. The restaurant food is excellent i would recommend it any time, Shrimps at around $15 (big ones), meat around $12 (i recommend the filet minon). Rooms should be like"
40,"This is a great spot for convenient, not too expensive, easy access to airport and Hedman Alas bus depot.  They were very accomodating for me traveling solo with a sick young child (who got sick on the airplane).  We were the last ones off of the plane and the driver was patiently waiting at the airport with a sign for us, I had just e-mailed that morning when I made reservations online, so wasn't sure if that would happen.  The staff at the front desk were very friendly and most spoke English quite well.  The rooms are about what you'd expect in this price range and clean. As noted in another review, we had our one queen size bed with window overlooking the main street. The windows are good quality and keep the sound out when closed, there are AC units in each room and nice"
40,Just needed a place to stay in between flights. The staff were great - emailed ahead of time to arrange pick up from the airport (free shuttle!) and arranging a taxi for the next morning. (Shuttle starts at 5:00 - I think - and we needed to be there in time to check in for a 6:30 flight.)
40,"We stayed at the Howard Johnson in Guatemala City on 11/21/2010 and had a fine and quiet room with a good complimentary breakfast and complimentary shuttle to the airport.    We spent 11 days in Guatemala and for our last night (after a 10 hr bus ride) we just wanted something easy and hassle free as our launching point for our flight out the next day.  The location was an easy cab ride (less than 10 minutes for an overpriced fee of Q50) from the Linea Dorada bus station (which we successfully took to and from Flores for our visit to Tikal) and an easy ride to the airport.  We paid a total of $86 for our queen bed sized room, which is a lot for Guatemala but worth it for us on the last night.  I found this hotel on Expedia and chose it based on it being the least expensive hotel"
40,"Most of the staff was speaking English. Good service but poor beeakfast. The accounting servis was totally disappointment.. The lobby is amazing. The location of the hotel was very pleasent, close to a nice shopping center. Pool was amazing!"
40,"This hotel has been modernised and remodelled, with very good spaces for a nice stay in a very safe area. The rooms are clean and well organised, and breakfast is always fresh and tasty. Only two little observations for your staying: coffee machine is not in your room, but there's always coffee at the lobby. Second one, pillows are not the best you can have, so pick the right one."
50,"My niece had her prom at the hotel next to the Biltmore and my family and I reserved rooms for the night. It’s a close ride from the airport, rooms are clean and nicely put together. Free WiFi is a plus and I know my reservation includes a complimentary breakfast. "
40,"Great staff, easy check-in.  Easy for an English speaker to check in and get questions answered.  The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable,  The rain shower head in the bathroom is fabulous.  Highly recommend.   Would gladly stay here again."
40,"I had a stay for business purpose. Biltmore was nearby the Camino Real Hotel, the owner is the same for both hotels. Open pool, SPA and restaurants were common for the both.  My room was on pool side and was wonderful. Rooms were large, fresh and clean. All the staff at front desk and the lobby were kind and helpfull. But the view of lobby was a bit poor."
30,Incredible my 3 points is just because de breakfast experience is terrible!! You ask for eggs and it takes 20 minutes! And then wrong order!!! Both days I stayed!! The room and service very good but the breakfast is a disaster 
50,"We stayed at this hotel on our first two nights of a 10-day vacation and on the last night.  Both stays were great.  We were a bit 'iffy' when we first reserved our room, but Marriott surely delivered their well-known superb service.  It was pricier than other hotels around the area, but the service and quality was worth it.    Both check-ins and check-outs went smoothly and the front desk workers who helped us were very professional.  The two maids that we came in contact with were extremely polite and helpful.  Their shuttle service leaves at certain times (a couple every hour, or so) and the driver was nice enough to go to our room and let us know that he was ready to take us to the rental car company to return our car and back to the hotel.  He even waited for us in a gas"
50,"I stayed here at the end of September and all staff members I encountered from shuttle driver to the desk attendants were very professional and friendly. The staff for the restaurant-bar area were fantastic, especially Alejandro & Andrea who were very attentive. Most employees I spoke with knew English or at least some to understand, even though I do speak Spanish, so for people who don't know Spanish this is a nice little perk. I found the beds to be very comfortable, rooms clean, everything in its place. Oh and the showers are awesome and they even provide a rubber mat for safety!"
50,"I loved this hotel. It is new, nicely decorated, spacious, with beautifull and modern rooms. The restaurant is very good and all the satff is very nice. The gym is well equipped, with not so many machines but with dumbells rack, swiss balls, etc. Nice quality, with free shuttle from and to the airport. Wifi works very good, which is not usual."
50,"Nice hotel, new and clean, some rooms have balconies.....They have a bistro restaurant that has a nice large varied menu.....and you can get the food ""to go"" as they do not offer room service.  The breakfast buffet is pretty well stocked, I found that there were 2 egg dishes generally, but they both had similiar ingredients (on day mushrooms in both).....BUT you gotta try their fresh orange juice machine, INCREDIBLE!!!  The hotel is located in the downtown hotel zone so there are several all around, Radison, Holiday Inn, Hilton Garden, and Westin (I tried the Westin, nice but old rooms).  They also have a pretty extensive gym!  Ice is on every other floor."
50,"Stayed here for one night and I will stay here again if I'm back in the area. Arranged everything in advance as I arrived solo on a late flight into GC and they had a driver at airport as planned. Less than 5 minute drive to the hotel. The man I booked the accommodation with was on site to welcome me and go over everything to ensure I had a good stay (breakfast location and time, mosquito-deterrent in room, etc.) Breakfast the next morning was wonderful. This place was great and I highly recommend it."
40,"For a one or two night stay this is the perfect hotel near the airport and down town as well. It is simple, reasonable, clean, functional and comfortable. The museums in Guatemala City are well worth visiting, but since the town does not have the safest reputation we only stayed one day to do that and took cabs instead of walking to them."
40,"Nice rooms, attentive stuff, clean bathrooms and a nice little garden. I arrived almost two hours early but they checked me in and organized for my cab ride for the following morning. The cab driver was prompt and very friendly. The hostel is in a residential gated community and there is no restaurant on site, they have restaurants which deliver though. "
50,"The service was excellent, rooms very clean ,  friendly  staff  they went far and beyond of our needs we where very pleased of the warm atmosphere surrounding, free shuttle to the airport very prompt in picking us up. Very good security it was a must, close to the airport less than 15 minutes away. Continental breakfast had several menus to chose. Traveling to zone10 where most of the restaurants and night life about 25 minutes due to traffic. Traveling to historic downtown Zone 1 about 35 minutes. Climate excellent with ample transportation at your convenience. The hotel is family own. In overall we where absolutely very please at the hotel that we spent two weeks there, I highly recommend this hotel for the amenities. For a Hairdryer you have to ask for one. The Month of April"
40,"I had an overnight stop in Guatemala City and needed somewhere to stay that was close to the airport for an early morning departure. I booked into Hostal Villa Toscana Bed and Breakfast. Hostal Villa Toscana is less than a five minute drive to the departures level at the airport. They provide a free shuttle to the airport which was convenient. It is located within a guarded area of the city so is fairly secure.  I had a single room which was adequate for me although it was small, about 6 feet wide. I had a single bed, TV, writing table and chair and bathroom with shower (not shared). The room included free WiFi which was fast. The B&B includes a breakfast which was served in a very pretty and well maintained courtyard. There were eight choices of breakfast with extras available"
50,"I find it realy hard to believe how other people can write negative reviews about this place.  It has charm because they decorated the hotel and all the rooms with Spanish motives and decorative fixtures.  It is very affordable and the attached restaurant is FREAKING AWESOME.  The food is great and since the guatemalan quatzel is 8 times less than canadian or american dollar it is very affordable.  They have 12 cakes and pies to choose from for desert.  Most of the staff does not speak english but there are some that speak perfect english and they are VERT helpful.  We are in Guatemala, there is no where you can go where people speak english, you just make due with what it is.  It is centrally located on Avenida Reforma which is a beautiful street. Definiately coming here again."
30,"Our one night stay was okay.  I would stay there again, but only if I needed something close to the airport.  Free airport shuttle service was included.  It was what you would expect of a Howard Johnson’s in the States.  Our room was clean and comfortable with a nice bathroom.  We had a decent breakfast in the hotel restaurant."
30,"The front desk help either spoke no english or very little. Our room and bath were clean and the ac worked great! There is a restaurant also, we had dinner once it was ok and breakfest once it was also ok. We are both vegetarians and had a few things to pick from on the menu. Overall the actual hotel was ok, not great but for what we paid it was around what we expected. If your on a budget and just want a clean room and bath I'd recomend this hotel. It was a fast cheap taxi to zona viva also about $5."
40,We stayed at the HoJo for 1 night and were very impressed with the service.  There was a representative from the hotel waiting for us outside the airport exit with a sign with our name on it.  Within seconds we were escorted to the waiting van and the free shuttle to the hotel.  Checkin was smooth and no surprises.  We had a room with 3 queen beds which was great for our family of four.  Our room was good size  but I could see the regular rooms being small.  The carpet was pretty nasty but overall cleanliness was good.  Breakfast in the morning was included in the room rate and was outstanding.  Service was excellent as well  in the morning as we were given a free shuttle ride to pick up our car.  Overall I would recommend this hotel.  Rooms are not the best but service was
10,"Worse service ever!  Smelly and tiny room. Too much noise from cars and people coming from the Reforma Ave. Food poisoned in their restaurant. The personnel in the lobby don't know what they are doing and treats you in a rude manner. Shuttle to the airport left late and almost lst my flight.Checking in and out is a nightmare, could not even get a receipt for my stay. I was lectured by Rafael Cruz (incharge of front desk) on how ""I don't know anything of how hotels work and forget about my Onepass miles"", even if I had booked my stay at Continental.com. Terrible customer service.   Not recommended, not again..."
50,"You won’t regret staying at barcelo.  The location is great just few blocks away from restaurants , shopping mall , lounges n discos..the rooms are clean , swimming pool is clean, breakfast buffet every morning , an overall pleasant stay."
50,"The hotel is perfectly located, walking distance to stores, food, pharmacies, park and airport. Food is great and the people is amazing. Always ready to treat you as VIP. Those that love WIFI this is your hotel, amazing connection! "
30,"It’s a five-star except for a couple of deficiencies. The largest one being noise. I saw in the hotel provided description that the rooms are soundproof.  But that’s from your neighbors, not the jets that seemingly thunder overhead. The bathrooms are out of date and on the small side. But the shower head and water force is magnificent!   The staff are always ready to help. It’s very secure and as others have noted, convenient to many of the sites by Uber or taxi.   The room had a small fridge that was empty! Exactly what visitors want since we generally go out and buy fixins for our lunches. The balcony outside had two chairs to sit and look out over the city and distant mountains (see picture). A thermostat controlled the temperature well with a ‘low’ setting that helped"
50,"I read some negative comments about elevators... maybe they have improved due to those remarks. I would push the button and the elevator was always there for me! Best elevator experience in any hotel in the world. Breakfast was nice and the service was friendly. Large Swimming pool with Jacuzzi and Fitness. Basically everything is in or around the hotel. Uber taxis are cheap in Guatemala, so no worries for transportation. Free Airport Shuttle awaits you at the airport and has AC and good working (free) Wifi."
40,Make sure you enter through the front of the hotel of the main entrance (there are different parking areas with the Barcelo sign). Just a few blocks from the hotel is a nice mall and lots of local areas to find authentic food from street vendors at very cheap prices.  Also a local supermarket with bottled water for a few cents on the dollar. 
40,"Very nice, small, quaint hotel. Good service, clean, comfy beds. Close to everything, including a family favorite restaurant Hacienda Real, in walking distance. Here just for the weekend and to see cirque du soleil, which was on my wife’s bucket list. "
30,"In spite of the fact that we booked our room before the others in our party did (coming from Oregon), so that we would all be together, no room for us, but for the others. About 11:30pm after nearly 12 hours of travel. Also had to wait for the transportation for about 20 minutes in spite of being about 5 minutes away. The hotel did pub us up in the Westin, an adjoining sister property, which worked fine. Same rate. Breakfast at the Biltmore was super. Our other travelers said they would stay here again."
10,This  was  the  best hotel  on  my  tour. Pure luxury  to  an  affordable price. Good  breakfast. Safe location. Free  air-port transfer. Well working wifi. Nice staff. Close  to  resaurants  and  trans-metro  station. What  more  do  you  need?
30,Amazing new renovations of rooms and comfy beds.  Would have had a great night sleep if I didn’t have to listen to the party or disco going on until 2 am!    A shame because hotel is very nice with friendly front desk staff and good airport service at 5 am.   
50,"Clean, efficient (received my 3:30am wake up fall, airport shuttle by the front door at 4:00am), and had a great hot shower.  Would stay there again if I had an early AM flight.  Walked around the area but it looks like this area closes down to foot traffic around 4:30pm."
50,"Stay at this hotel everytime I go to Guatemala on business, aprox 4 times/year. Hotel is conveniently located in ""Zona 10"", a nice area, easy to move around the city. Hotel staff provide super customer service. Rooms very well kept. Great quality of the food. All in all a great hotel to stay not only for business but for pleasure as well.  I would like to congratulate Andrea Hernandez and Mynor Villatoro for such an amazing customer service. Thank you for making me feel like if I was home."
40,"We stayed 3 nights with a group and friends. The hotel is centrally located, well decorated and the staff was friendly.  Breakfast is ok, nothing special. There is a gym and a terrace, no swimming pool.   There is a shuttle that takes you from the airport.   All in all we liked it, I would recommend it ñ."
50,"Stayed here for only two nights. From the start, great experience overall. Got picked up at the airport by a hotel service, 15 minutes to the hotel. You need to take an elevator to get to the main lobby, but that's fine. The lobby itself is large, and since the hotel is fairly new, everything looks clean, modern and welcoming.  Attention at check-in was great. The room is large, everything was working perfectly, the bathroom had great pressure and a good size. Internet was very stable and very acceptable at 10mb sustained. The breakfast was good, with a selection of eggs, omellets, pancakes, breads and juices. The lunch/dinner menu was also varied enough for a quick bite, although it's not an impressive restaurant. But there are plenty of restaurants on the hotel street. The gym"
50,Caught the bus from San Salvador to Guatemala City. The bus stopped a few blocks away. The hotel is modern and very nice place. Enjoyed the dining area. The rooms are nicely furnished and modern. Felt safe walking in the nearby neighborhood at night. 
50,Very Happy with my choice of this hotel.  Welcoming staff and very comfortable bedding.  Excellent locations with many good restaurants inside hotel and nearby.  Modern and fresh furnishings.  Very comfortable.  Great hotel with a great price.
20,"This might be a great review if I just stuck to the wonderful staff who were so accomodating, professional, responsible and always delivered on their promises.  It might be a great review if I commented only on the prompt FREE airport pickup and return. It meant so much for us to land in a country where we had never been, where our Spanish is virtually nonexistent, and where we've read about a high crime rate, particularly at the airport, to walk out and immediately see a lovely driver with a sign with our name on it, who escorted us to a large clean van and promptly delivered us to the hotel.  It might also be great if we noted the rock bottom price which included a hot, cooked to order, substantial breakfast with waiter service, tablecloths and tasty food.  The neighborhood"
30,"I spent one night at this Hotel in July 2008. Just making a stop-over in Guatemala City, this Hotel was the cheapest option available near the airport among the ones offered by Expedia.  The best point about this Hotel is that they offer free pickup and transportation at/to the airport. I found that very convenient and everything went well.  For the rest, the Hotel is just on par with the standard-quality midrange business hotels. My room was decent though plain and aged. Nothing to be exited about, but ok as a place to sleep. Front desk service was also ok, with courteous and friendly staff.  I found location not that convenient. In the area of the city called ""Zona 9"", though I realize it is not far from the restaurant and entertainment Zona 10 area, I didn't dare walking"
40,"I checked-in to the HoJo after spending more than three weeks at the Marriott.  The Marriott was great, but as my stay ended up being much more lengthy than anticipated, I chose to move to a less expensive place.  Never having been to Guatemala, I was particularly cautious about neighborhoods and crime.  The photos that I saw of the HoJo made it look a little dingy, and i could never figure out the neighborhood thing.  So I played it safe and initially stayed at the Marriott.  However, while I was staying at the Marriott, I accidentally stumbled across the HoJo while out on a walk.  I popped in to check it out.  I looked at the lobby, spoke with the manager, and moved into the HoJo the next day.  It was a great move!  In hindsight, I wish that I'd stayed here from the outset. "
50,"We were so surprised to get off the plane in Guatemala City and see a representative from HoJo's waiting for us.  We made the reservation the night before on Expedia and hadn't even told them we were flying in and there they were waiting for us.  They provided free shuttle to and from the airport.  The staff was very friendly and helpful- recommending good restaurants, setting up shuttles to Antigua, and assisting us with whatever we needed.  The complimentary breakfast was great too.  The hotel was nicely decorated... and very clean.  There is free wireless, but to use their computers, you need to pay a small fee.  Overall, a fantastic experience... especially for the price~! "
10,"I had a terrible experience at this hotel. You do not have any privacy; the reception is like the police department. I had two friends from the city and we were hanging out and we went to the hotel and we were not allowed to go up to the room. I was told that it was internal policy. Also they told me that my room was for single or married people, so I guess they do not accept that gay people could be marriage. If you are married with kids go ahead, book with them, but if you are single ""forget about it"" "
30,"This is the first time I’ve stayed here(4nights), looks like there were some upgrades… Chipped and moldy tile in the shower, carpets needed a cleaning in the room. The breakfast was OK, usually eggs were gone, specific fruits gone and it took quite a while for the food to be replenished. Staff are great, housekeeping was wonderful. They have a partnership with Westin camino real- meaning you can access their pool and exercise room for $10 a time. Make sure you clarify cost for airport shuttle, water in your room, fee for breakfast. Sometimes it is complementary and I’m finding out sometimes it is not."
50,The property seems newly renovated and the rooms were very comfortable.  The property is very clean and the staff was friendly.  The hotel is walking distance to some nice restaurants and offers a free shuttle to the airport.  We were very pleased with the Hotel Biltmore!
40,"I have to stay in this hotel for a business trip. It was a very nice experience... the rooms are very clean and big! Also Diana, the sub manager was very nice and polite!!! I have a lot of requests and questions and she always was there when I needed her!"
40,"The hotel was very nice.  The staff very friendly and helpful.  Our team was 21 high schoolers, 2 coaches and 2 parents.  The breakfast buffet was perfect for our athletes before their long day of games.  They had everything, eggs, beans, sausages, different kinds of cereal, pastries, 3 kinds of juice, coffee and tea. The seating area was roomy and comfortable.  The rooms very spacious and clean.  My room had a view of a wall.  My suggestion would be to pain something pretty on that wall so it’s not so ugly when you open the window but other than that it was nice.  We didn’t have time to go to the nearby mall that was recommended but heard it was very nice!   Definitely would consider staying there again on our next visit."
40,Clean large room with very good cable TV. Great breakfast.  Excellent comfortable beds.  The shared shuttle to and from the airport (shared by nearby hotels)  is very convenient.  If using the business center bring a flash light as it is very dim there.  A door between the elevators and the cafeteria takes you to the Camino Real Hotel and its pool and restaurants.
10,"I trust Trip Advisor and saw that this hostal was highly rated, so I booked this 6 months out.  I am at a complete loss as to why my experience differed so greatly from those who gave it a high rating!  We arrived about 7 PM and let the clerk know we were leaving for the airport at 11 PM. We just wanted to rest and shower as it had already been a very long day and we were beat.  We were given room #4, near to the desk.  Immediately upon entering the room we were surprised at how warm it felt and how small the beds were.  We were too tired to think so I laid down and my companion took a shower. Well, he actually was unable to shower as there was no hot water and no water pressure.  I was attempting to sleep, but there was music coming from outside.  I had to close the windows in"
10,"Just wanted to get a few hours sleep and a shower before a red eye flight. There is no hot water, no water pressure, no hairdryer, no bottled water!  Everything said at the front desk can be heard from our room. The clerk has a cough and he coughs every few minutes.  Sleep or rest are impossible!  Oh, did I mention the mosquitos?  What a terrible experience. Hope this review saves you from the same. "
40,"This hotel is a lovely older home with antique furnishings.  The staff was very helpful.  Not sure if they speak English or not as I spoke in Spanish.  The rooms were very clean and comfortable.  Bathrooms had good hot water and pressure.  We arrived late and left early so didn't get to try their complimentary breakfast but they did give us juice, fruit and granola bar to take with us.  My only complaint was there was no bottled water in the room although they did give us a couple of glasses to take up to our rooms.  We stayed the first night and decided to come back the night before we left.  It was literally two minutes from the airport."
10,"--- The staff/concierge was not friendly or helpful with information about local activities, entertainment, or restaurants. They just replied ""I don't know"" to all of my questions. --- Concierge insisted that I only take the taxis they ordered me, which were TRIPLE the price of the local metered taxis. I had to walk away from the property in order to catch my own taxis but it was worth the money $$$$ I saved. --- I was overcharged: When I checked in at the hotel they charged me 20% more than my online booking reservation. I have receipts to prove this (check my attached photos). --- The water did not run hot in the morning. --- Free breakfast was a bottle of orange flavored juice and a granola bar.  --- Walls are paper thin. You can hear full conversations very clearly from the"
40,We spent the night there before leaving early the next morning. The beds were comfortable and it is within 5 minutes of the airport. The staff was very helpful and the transfers to and from the airport are included. I enjoyed the garden area in the back. You feel like you are somewhere besides the busy city. Breakfast is included and they have take out at various restaurants that will deliver. Perfect place to start and end your trip.
50,"It is a great hotel, good location ,big swimmingpool with Jacuzzi, good breakfast, good Wifi connection. Bathroom is good, but a bit dated. The Fridge/ Minibar was empty. I like some drinks in the fridge the 1st night I arrive in the hotel. Only water is not enough for me. I know I could have ordered Room-service, but I prefer a soda or juice in the fridge. Small improvements would make it perfect!"
30,"I ended up at this hotel after a nightmarish situation on American Airlines, so I do want to issue a caveat with this review because I was probably in a bad mood about being here to begin with.  After many hours of flight delays and departing for the United States twice and both times having mechanical issues in the sky requiring our plane to go back to GC, American finally cancelled our flight and put all of the grumpy people from my flight up at this hotel for the night.   I think this used to be a really nice hotel in it's hey-day, but walking into the lobby kind of reminded me of a movie set about a hotel in the 80s.  The lobby was very clean and the employees were nice, but the furnishings looked really old.    The room they put me in was clean and pretty decent, but if you"
50,"The Barcelo has most everything you need; a large pool, hot tub, gym, 3 restaurants and more staff to help you than what is the norm.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were very nice.  We really enjoyed our stay and it always helps when there are lots of staff members that speak English and the Barcelo succeeded in that department.  The hotel is also very close to the airport which is handy in that extremely busy city  I would highly recommend this hotel."
50,"This is a wonderful hotel with nice rooms excellent ,food,a warm pool and awesome service.. it has a nice shuttle to the airport. Nice buffet meals are available. The hot tub is nice. I would recommend this hotel"
40,"This hotel is in a great location. My room was 702, on a corner with 2 balconies and it was lovely. I didn't like that you needed to contact the staff to obtain a secondary key for the minibar. I thought the atm fee was too high. The food was excellent at breakfast and dinner in the main buffet, but that was not at all the case in the sports bar. My toilet stopped flushing the last morning of my stay and I had to reach into the tank and pull the chain so that was unpleasant. But the staff was excellent and I'd stay here agian."
50,"Stayed here recently with my daughter who was adopted from Guatemala. While dining at the hotel restaurant with her large foster family, the general manager sent over ice cream for the kids at no charge. Our waiter, Alejandro Tiul, couldn't have been more solicitous to our unwieldy group. Everyone on staff, from check in through checkout, was extremely kind--even the front desk person and night manager when my daughter was ill in the night and paramedics came to our room. The night manager acted as translator and was so kind and helpful. Excellent breakfast buffet, too."
50,"This hotel scores highly on all fronts:  Located in the popular Zona 10, with many food options around.  Bright interiors - fantastic lobby with many workstations. Good food - the breakfast buffet spread was impressive. But what makes it special is the staff. More than one occasion where team members went out of the way to ensure that things are right.  Special mention: Ashlei, Johnny, Roberto (front desk) and Andres, Alejandro, Yonatan, Andrea.  Inspiring to see such level of commitment."
50,Great location near many other shops/ dining/cafe options.  Bed - terrific; bathroom clean and spacious. Big area for sofa and working. Wifi very good. Lobby was open and large for the eat/bar/ meeting requirements. Plenty of art and decor for our enjoyment and the gym was adequate with a small outdoor area to visit or look at during workout. Lobby is actually on 2nd floor which became a bit annoying after so many in/out and waiting for elevator to go 1 floor up from street level to lobby. Pretty new hotel and the airport shuttle is a big help. *free*
40,"I stayed in this hotel in Aug'18.  The Good.  1. Very polite, friendly, helpful front desk. 10/10. I congratulate senior manager for having a well behaved front desk!  2. decent internet.  3. decent bed.  4. netflix app fitted in TV.  5. complimentary water bottle provided.  6. Great location at walking distance from other hotels/restaurants  7. Great gym which i used!  8. When leaving hotel the hotel paid for my taxi as shuttle was not avbl!  9. Great AC.  10. good housekeeping. very polite ladies. I congratulate the GM for their good training!  11. Very good breakfast including eggs on order and capuccino on order!   The problems  1. The hotel does not have a airport pick up shuttle. I waited for it for 30 minutes before spending 10 usd on a taxi. The front desk told me, once"
50,"I stayed in a suite which was much larger than I expected. The pull out sofa bed is small, possibly the size of a full bed, but felt more like a twin. Perfect for a child/teenager. The balcony was a nice and unexpected treat. The room feels modern and still looks new. There was a fire alarm at 9 am one day of my 7 night stay, but the front desk staff quickly answered my call and told me it was a false alarm. They were very courteous and apologetic. I experienced no other problems. I wished they had a pool but had a nicely appointed gym instead. The breakfast at the hotel was of very high quality and it varied from morning to morning. The fried sweet plantains were amazing and should not be skipped. The waiters were in point, very responsive, and treated me like family. I’m very"
40,"I've stayed at this property three times.  The front desk and overall staff is efficient.  The breakfast food is subpar, but the staff is attentive.  The rooms are clean, she showerheads are outstanding, and the pillows plentiful.  There are usb ports in the room which proved useful.  On my last stay housekeeping arrived late afternoon everyday.  The room views left much to be desired.   "
30,"Their elevators were dirty and olds The floor carpets were detached On the day of departure we left all the equipment arranged just to return from breakfast and close suitcases and leave, I was surprised that at that time the room service came to take the food plates the day before and left them in front of the door, I imagine Which is because the clients have taken them, but I did not like having already left everything in my suitcases just to close them ayan entered and did not wait for us to perform the check-out because, being the room already vacated can enter to make inventory of Everything and inform, it seemed to me very bad taste, when leaving the hotel after 2 hours I remembered that when I check the room before leaving in the refrigerator I had left half a cheese and"
50,"The location, staff, breakfast and hotel shuttle were great. As far as Guatemala goes this place far exceeds expectations. The only problem was we thought we had payed for a bigger room. I never asked the staff about it because we were very happy with the room we got. I would highly recommend this place. "
10,"Not worth my stay, the rooms are acceptable, and the breakfast is ok. The location is considerably close to restaurants and so forth. The customer service was blah...there was a receptionist in training who never smiled and looked scared to be there the whole time. The hotel is clean, but the people are not friendly or helpful. During our arrival nobody offered to help with our luggage. This is not a professional hotel and I will never come back here. We stayed for a couple of days since we were visiting other places in Guatemala, we needed to come back after a few days to get ready to leave to the airport and decided to stay at another near by hotel. Don't expect special service from this hotel. "
50,"We stayed here for a night after coming back from the Rio Dulce on our way home to Puerto Morelos and we couldn't have been happier with our stay. The staff was friendly from the moment we got there. We had a room that had a window close to the night club across the street, and when I asked when they were open until, the receptionist replied, ""pretty late...will that be too loud?"" She then offered to move us to a more quiet room for free. We will stay here every time we come through Guatemala City. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
50,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. The people were very polite and helpful -- ready to go the extra mile. There is a restaurant on the premises. Their prices are very reasonable and the food is good. The room was comfortable and very clean. I had everything I needed. Internet access is FREE. I was able to hook up my own laptop to a broad band connection in my own room. It was very easy to locate their shuttle coming out of the airport, and they took me back on time. Everyone was eager to help. It is a superb place to stay, even when you are on a budget. "
50,"We stayed here the last night of our vacation and found it to be  a quiet, comfortable place, with a super friendly staff. We had a really great time in Guatemala and by the time we got here all we wanted to do was relax, have something to eat ( delivered to your room from take out menu) and get to bed early for our flight the next morning. We had an upstairs room with a small balcony overlooking the garden and in the morning they wake you up and take you to the airport, which is minutes away. This is a great choice for a first or last night in Guatemala, with a great, secure location."
50,"Villa Toscana was great! Super close to airport (2 min) but quiet. Shuttle was available both ways, good breakfast and comfy spacious room. Only drawback was the easiest option for dinner was expensive take-out (menu from nearby(?) restaurants available at desk and delivered to room) since there didn't seem to be good options close by to walk to. But we'd go back!"
40,"The window in my room wouldn't close so it was really cold throughout the night.  Shower was pretty lukewarm. Wifi signal was very weak in my room.  Other than that- my stay was fine.  The gentleman working at the front desk was very, very helpful and friendly.  Since I arrived late after a day of traveling, he was able to have food (dinner) delivered to my room. The place is right next to the airport- it only takes less than 5 minutes to arrive at the departures area.  Great for early morning flights- sleep in a bit longer."
50,"My wife had pulled muscles in the back of her leg previous to are arrival at the hotel. We had to carry her in to the room. The lady at the front desk asked if we wanted a Doctor. We said yes so she called one. In a matter of minutes a Doctor and paramedic arrived. The Doctor checked my wifes  leg and the paramedic gave her a needle for pain. The doctor gave her some medication for the next day. Also he wrote her a prescription for further medication. When we asked what we owed, the Doctor said it was free. The lady at the desk said it was a service they provide to guests. Unbelievable."
30,"Airport hotel. Shampoo and soap provided. No hot water plumbed to sink (apparently normal), hot water more like warm and  boarding on the cool. Nice garden. Noisy when planes take off. Good breakfast and good sized rooms. Wifi available in room"
40,We stayed in this well-located hotel to tour some of the villages around the city at the Days of the Dead. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. Our room was large and convenient. Staff was well informed and friendly.
50,"We stayed here since it was close to the airport with a shuttle before our early morning flight. We didn't have time to use the lovely pool but I was able to pick up some last minute souvenirs and enjoy a delicious dinner. Great value,  I would definitely stay here again !."
50,"What i love about this hotel is the view, the staff. Im for sure coming back, but this time with my husband. This is my first time coming to this hotel and I will be letting people know in the states. I really appreciate the good job the staff did."
50,"The staff was great, the place was really clean. They were hosting a prom at the time, and it was lovely to see all the dresses and the piano music in the lobby. We stayed on the premium level and it was worth it. The free food and drinks in the premium lobby was awesome "
50,"Excellent service and excellent internet. The restaurants offer very good food. Not only is the service excellent but it is 24 hours so anything I needed was attended to in a timely manner and very nice and able staff.  There is a lot of perfume pumped into all general areas so if you don't want that in your room, like me, just make sure to tell them and they will honor that."
50,It was such a good experience! The room was totally clean and all the amenities were very useful. When I came in at the hotel the ladies that were at the reception were  very attentive and helpful. The location is at the center of this beautiful city.
50,I have had many opportunities to stay at the Biltmore hotel in Guatemala City. Located across from the airport and the service is wonderful. Air conditioner is great and the full breakfast tastes great. Great value for your money. I will stay many more times.
40,"Well Located, rooms are confortable and clean, breakfast is included in rate and is good. The only observation is that in the room you are not provided with any stationary, nor writing pad nor a ballpoint pen and also you do not have a TV channel guide to tune in what you would like to see; you have to go channel by channel to find the one you are looking for and most of them are in Spanish. Staff at front desk are very courteous and helpful The hotel is part of the Westin Camino Real as it is adjacent to that Hotel Within a 4 block radius you can find good bars and restaurants."
50,I went to Guatemala last month for business and i stayed in this hotel for a week and a half. It has an amazing service plus the location couldn't be better and the rooms are amazing. Even the temperature of the pool was great!
50,I stayed a few days in the hotel. They have great rooms and a really good. I left very satisfied of the place and wishing to return as soon as possible. Highly recommended if you stayed be sure that you will have a great time.
40,"1) Hotel is very close to the airport. 2) They have free airport pick up and drop shuttle, i used it for airport drop and it is every hour. 3) Nice lobby, good spacious and comfortable rooms. 4) They offer in room Spa Service 5) Good Spread of breakfast. 6) Nice Staff, good service at the Bar. 7) Easy check in and Check out 8) Only drawback is they do not have in room service, you order from room and need to come down to lobby to collect it. 9) there is a very good restaurant near the hotel beside the parking lot.  Would recommend to stay at this hotel."
50,"We came to Guatemala for a wedding.  We stayed at the Courtyard prior to the short ride to the wedding hotel in Antigua.  The Courtyard room was excellent, the amenities like the fitness room, clean and convenient, and the hotel restaurant and bar wonderful.  The staff were helpful, friendly and happy to take the time to speak to us at length.  We would look forward to staying there again."
50,"The hotel premises are excellent! Very comfortable and clean rooms with a tasty breakfast included on the per night rate and a convenient location.  Even traveling for business is a pleasure when the staff, the premises and the rooms are enjoyable.   I ♥️ the breakfast! "
50,Very nice hotel. Spotlessly clean and it’s Only one year old. Employees are all very helpful from the from desk to cleaning staff. All very pleasant and helpful. Highly recommend this hotel. The hotel is located in zone 10.  
50,"Beautiful location. Good service. And impecable rooms. Restaurant has few options but great atmosphere to seat at their lobby place to have a drink after a work day. Servers are amazing. Mynor, Emilio and Andres were so nice, they go beyond their duties to make you feel god. Hopefully will be back soon."
40,"I often bring groups here because it is a very safe, comfortable and convenient place to stay close to Aurora Airport! Breakfast is included in the price of your room. If needed they will take you to the airport which is less than 5 minutes away! Great staff!"
50,My family and I have stayed here many times for work and for personal. Azucena and her staff are delightful and sweet. The place is beautiful and well decorated. The free breakfast is delicious and the courtyard is a lovely place to sit. The location being so close to the airport makes it very convenient when we are traveling to pick up guests or returning teams.
50,"This little hotel was the perfect answer for our travels in Guatemala. It is located about 5 minutes from the airport and they include airport transfers and breakfast in the room price.  We arrived late one night and a driver was waiting outside of customs with our name on a card and took us right to the hotel. We collapsed in a very clean, quiet room adjacent to the garden and breakfast patio. The next morning we sat in the lovely garden and had a made-to-order breakfast, tipico eggs and fruit and cafe con leche. On our last night in Guatemala, 2 weeks later, we arrived exhausted and Sergio showed us to our room and assured us the cab would be ready for our 5 AM departure. He even made us coffee at 5 AM!! The cab was there as promised and we were at the departure area 5 minutes"
20,"I stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to the airport.  I had an early morning flight and they offer a free shuttle.  The shuttle was late and I had a stressful time catching my flight.  I would have rated the hotel higher if the shuttle had been reliable.  i was traveling alone and they only were able to book me into a double, and more expensive room.  The room was supposed to have a bathroom, and it did, but across the hall.  When the shuttle did not come as scheduled, I asked about hailing a taxi and was told that it was not safe to do so in that area.  I left too early to try the breakfast that was included with the room.  There is no restaurant at the hotel or within safe walking distance.  They will order take out for you.  The hotel is clean."
50,"I've stayed her several times and it continues to be the perfect option for late arrivals and early departures at La Aurora. The rooms are clean. Complimentary airport taxi to/from airport terminal. ($7 to military terminal for flights to Flores.) Staff is friendly and helpful. On this trip some business colleagues arrived and we were able to work at outside garden tables. Good breakfast if you are there after 7am. Otherwise they send you to the airport with orange juice, yogurt and granola bars. This is located behind a gated community with a security guard. It feels quite safe. Recommended."
50,"Centralized location with lots of shopping and places to eat.  Near museums, the airport, malls and the City’s center.  Business friendly and family friendly too.  Staff is always professional and welcoming.  "
50,"I usually stay at the Barcelo when traveling through Guatemala City, because it is 10 minutes from the airport. It is a very comfortable, the staff are pleasant and courteous. The reception staff all speak English and are very responsive to questions and requests. Rooms are average size, but very comfortable. There are several excellent restaurants in the hotel. American style fast food is within one block walking distance. I've been told by staff (and by friends in Guatemala) that the tap water in the hotel is safe; however, I use bottled water for drinking and brushing my teeth anyway, just because it's a habit when I'm in Guatemala. Several excellent museums are a 20Q ($3) Uber ride away. For $80-90 a night (including a huge breakfast buffet) this is like a $200/night hotel"
40,"Stayed for 3 days , nice rooms and excellent staff , Good location not very far from Airport , they provide airport drop . over all great value for money . Break fast is good with wide variety . Food is good ."
50,"I actually rate hotels not just on the room and value, but also on the price I paid. This time I paid 81$ including breakfast which was a last min offer.   The rooms are kind of old, but big enough. The air conditioning system is also old, but working well. The bathroom was big enough and with everything you need.   Overall, the room was clean, but not renovated for years.   Breakfast is actually great and always worth to go for it.   The hotel has several restaurants you could visit, parking and WiFi is included.   For 81$ the hotel is worth the price and a recommendation. If you pay 120$ I’m not sure if I would rate it with 5 points.  "
50,Very nice and professional staff who are very willing and helpful. I felt very safe at this hotel and they had great amenities with a ton of meeting rooms with all different sizes. This place is quite huge too. There are nice restaurants and such here.
50,"I went to Guatemala for vacations and my friends recommended me this hotel and this was the best decision I've ever had. The room, gym, food, everything was really complete. The whole hotel was really secure and perfectly cleaned. I'll absolutely go back without thinking twice. My friends and I had a really good time. "
50,"I was staying there for almost a month for a business trip. The place is incredible. I was assigned to a room with a nice view of the hotel.  The staff is superb and would go beyond to accommodate you with all your needs. As soon as you check in and being greeted with a smile you already feel part of the family. Even the security would greet with you a smile. Excellent service. Breakfast buffet was good has a variety of food  to choose from, fruits cereals, etc. There is also a pool, gym, spa that you can use. Different cuisine restaurants to choose on site. Would definitely go back!"
50,"We spent one night in Guatemala City and decided to stay here due to the great reviews on TA.  Great location, if you want something close to the airport.  Free shuttle to/from.  Lots of restaurants and markets close by.  Clean and spacious rooms with AC.  The staff that works there are super helpful, especially Diana and Hilda. They were extremely flexible with my check out time.  Great breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, assortment of fruit, sausages, beans, yogurt, cereal, pancakes, coffee, tea, etc.  what more do you want?  Highly recommend staying here."
50,"This is a great place to stay when you are in Guatemala City.  The hotel isn't very far from the airport and there  is a free shuttle service both coming and going. It is located in Zone 10 and within walking distance of Dante Park, Oakland Mall and lots of restaurants, a supermarket etc.  The front desk staff and everyone else there is very friendly and helpful, I have never encountered anyone rude and I stay there about 3 times a year.  There is a free breakfast buffet and now FREE internet in the rooms as well as in the lobby.  If you are going to an event at the Camino Real you can use the connecting door to take you through without having to walk outside at all.  The two hotels also share the parking garage which is well lit and secure, have the front desk validate your"
40,This was our first time in Guatemala. It was a pleasant stay. We were only there for one night. We did not spend much time at the hotel but everyone was friendly and helpful. We would stay here again if we return to Guatemala. 
40,"Stayed for a week here and really enjoyed our stay here especially because of the staff! Everyone was very welcoming and was happy to offer their assistance! I especially want to thank Andres at the front desk who helped us find things to do in the city and even printed out a map to help us navigate our way (since we preferred to walk around the city), also to Andrea,Emilio, Mynor, and William at the bar who made us awesome drinks and spent the time to educate us on Guatamalan liquor and hot chocolate!! Their room service was also very quick to deliver the things we needed. The hotel is in a great location in the city with lots of things to do nearby!"
50,"I’ve been to this hotel several times and I absolutely love it! It’s a brand new hotel with very nice rooms but that’s no the important part! The staff is amazing and they make me feel at home every time. Right now I’m a platinum member, but I’ve been treated very well since day one!! They even know the table that I like, the food and the little things that make my stay perfect every time.  Even if it’s late and I have to work, from nowhere any of them show up with a cup of caffe to help me trough the night.  The are my family when I’m outside my country. Andrea, Jacki, Ashlie, Jhonny, Emilio, Minors, Jose, Willy, just to name a few are incredible people   You think I’m exaggerating? Just see the pictures below, I had to travel on my bday and they had a surprise party for me..."
40,Very nice but coffee in room is terribly weak and seems to come out of the machine lukewarm.  Awful.  Fitness center great.  Service great; very friendly for business visitors.  They did charge me $25 for leaving a day early after staying several nights and with plans to return for several nights in a few days.  Odd and not so friendly.  It doesn't have room service but you can call ahead for your meal from a small menu and then just pick it up.  That works fine but you need to not get in your PJ's before dinner!
40,I enjoyed my stay at this new hotel. I love the location and the fabulous lobby. It is very conducive to have small meetings throughout the lobby area. The breakfast offers great options. The rooms are very large and great beds!
40,"Great, clean, centrally located hotel. Zone 10 is totally safe at night - not if your stumbling around drunk, though where would it be? - with a couple bodegas across the street to buy bottled water, etc... The shuttle is great, when it actually shows up. The second visit for me, there was no shuttle even though it was confirmed twice and had to scramble for a taxi - shakes head. Taxis should cost 50-75Q all in from the airport to zone 10."
40,"This little hotel is in a gated community, so safe in the big city, and extremely close to the airport.  When it was raining we could drive into a roofed driveway to unload the baggage out of the rain.  Sergio who speaks English and Spanish was very kind and attentive at all hours and waited for us when we were running late.  Departing for the airport at 5 am (free), I was even given a granola bar and orange juice to take with me (that surprised me).    Staff was friendly and food was good, and even others staying there were friendly.  The wi-fi was down all weekend but they did try hard to restore it; when it came on it was slow in my room.  I couldn't get the room TV remote to work even when I put new batteries in it, but maybe I just didn't know how it works.  Extremely"
50,"Beautiful oasis near the airport.  Sergio was wonderful, helpful, gracious, courteous, and always willing to please.  All in all the service was second to none!  The garden is really pretty with covered tables outside to eat or indoor seating.  There is a lounge area and the whole place is tranquil and beautiful.  Airport taxi included with hotel price and arrived timely.  The room was lovely ('Matrimonial'/King size bed upstairs), but the bathroom is tiny with barely enough room for our legs in front of the toilet.  The shower drain is a little slow, but could be worse.  They advertise a restaurant, and do cook the breakfast on site, though other meals are ordered out and delivered.  You can order from McDonalds to Chinese to Estancia (excellent Steakhouse), and the prices are"
50,"I've spent my last night in Guatemala at Villa Toscana the last three summers, to catch early morning flights.  They respond quickly to inquiries and reservation requests, are prepared for you when you arrive, and are ready with answers to any questions.  The property, in a gated neighborhood, is very secure.  The beds are comfortable, the wifi is strong throughout, and the water is hot.  If you're leaving before breakfast is served, they give you a juice and some granola bars to take to the airport - not ideal, but better than the places that don't do anything for you if you're leaving too early for them.  Prior reviews have complained about noise from the airport, but I haven't noticed it.  Regardless, you should be aware that planes take off directly over the city, so you"
50,"Spent a week at Hostal Villa Toscana.  Just minutes from the airport, this Hostal was quiet, clean, and very friendly.  Sergio took care of every daily detail for me.  I will definitely stay here again when I return to the city."
40,"I've stayed at several B&Bs near the Guatemala City airport. This was as good as any, but with much better beds. The staff is very nice, and the location is easier to get to than most. I'll stay here again.  My only issue is that sound travels so much inside the building. Other guests came in noisily at 11pm. That wouldn't be a problem if we weren't getting up at 3:30am for an early flight.   Be aware that their free airport transportation begins at 7am. We had to leave at 4am, and they arranged transportation for us, which was there on time. $7 USD wasn't a bad price for the service.   We brought our own dinner, and the hotel was great about providing a place for us to eat, providing plates and cutlery. Much nicer than most places we've stayed.  Other reviews said that they got"
40, Very clean and safe hotel. Great shuttle service until 10pm. Clean rooms with everything you need. Good neighborhood and close to the airport.  The only thing would be that it’s more expensive but I think it’s well worth it. 
40,"I have stayed before, this time I was wiser and booked under a rate that included breakfast.  Interesting enough as a platinum member at this location unless you choose a rate including breakfast it’s not complimentary.  Breakfast buffet had good options not just standard carbohydrates.    Room was spotless which for me is a major criterion.  Gym compact but rarely excessively busy.   Bed 🛏 was a bit bumpy,, thin mattress pad translated into being able to feel the seams in mattress. In general this visit was more favorable..  btw the Greek restaurant across the street has amazing food."
50,"This hotel is located in the Zone called the zona viva, close to great pubs, restaurants and within in mins from the airport. The shuttle service is great they pick me and my daughter up at 11:55pm and was a so easy to get to hotel and check in and be in the room. I was in the 6th floor and it was pleasant."
40,"A good hotel. We arrived late and we welcomed to the hotel. All the nice hotels are in this area of Guatemala City. We arrived too late to use the shuttle but the hotel is relatively close to the airport. Modern, clean, high standards. The only issue we had was a smell of cigarette in the hall way on our floor on arrival. The aroma was not present in our room and was gone in the morning. Otherwise a great hotel!"
50,"The Courtyard is brand new and the hotel is clean and stylish.  It's almost a boutique style hotel.  One tip, the hotel as a washing machine/dryer for guests. The location is great and there are several restaurants nearby."
40,"The best , interconnected with restaurants such as El cafetal and Café vienés. The quality of the breakfast can be better. At the tea time, maybe the hotel can provide more options. The room service is OK"
50,"The front desk team made me feel like home. I really recommend this hotel, is one of the best ones in Guatemala city. You will never forget your experience here, the room, the views and the people are just amazing.  The management is spectacular, always attentives to all your needs.  10/10 "
20,On the plus side the rooms are big and comfortable if slightly tired and the staff is friendly.  The downside - the walls are paper-thin and I could hear the people in the rooms adjacent to mine grunting and coughing all night long to the point where I thought someone was in my room.  Breakfast is mediocre - coffee runs out and the staff can't seem to keep up - and the space is very small so I had to sit in the lobby and wait to eat something until there was a seat.  
40,"The Biltmore is not flashy but delivers on most fronts. The breakfast is very complete and quite good for a buffet style. It is always crowded but has enough seating to accommodate everyone. The staff is in general nice and quick to respond. Previously, internet in your room was an extra charge but now it is included and is quite fast. I had a room facing a tennis court which was very quiet. The rooms are a bit stale with a dank hotel smell but overall a decent place."
40,"No complaints  Good service, great room - clean, comfy beds all high quality. Close to bars and dining options.   Service was brilliant, there was an issue with the beds in our room (we wanted twin and we got a king bed) , they were very accommodating and friendly."
50,"The hotel was reasonably priced with great food, good business facilities and friendly kind staff. Rooms are spotless with all possible extras, so far one of the best beds from my experience over 5 hotels in GT city and one of the only hotels that has balconies with view. Would definitely recommend "
50,"Convenient, and very professional and courteous staff.  There is a car rental inside the hotel which helped save time and money.  Safe hotel and safe surrounds with great restaurants close by.  Hotel food options are fantastic too."
50,"La Vista Restaurant my wife and I enjoy a la carte dinner and buffet lunch and dinner during our three nights on this hotel. My wife and I had a bad experience with a buffet dinner in the Vista restaurant. As I was feeling sick that night without an appetite to eat my wife ended up with the buffet dinner and I asked for a glass of water.  She tried to convinced me to had the buffet by given me a small piece of fish with her fork big mistake a staff lady from 3 tables apart approached us screaming ""sir you both can not share the food"" that was embarrassing in front of other people. Because of my upset stomach I was undecided about eating some food but after this experience I decided not have any. I am sure there is a better polite way to approached this kind of situations without"
10,The staff including managers are unhelpful and disrespectful. They don't have customer service. The bathtub glass door is leaky and water spills all the time when you take shower flooding the bath room. Old run down hotel. Don't Go there. We had stayed in Radisson hotel earlier and had an awesome experience. 
50,"I have certainly tried other options in GT City but this people at Barceló take excellence very seriously and I´m sure you won´t regret using their services, staying there really adds value to my work in Guatemala."
40,"I stayed at Villa Toscana while in the city for several days, and was very pleased with the location and service. They provided free transport to and from the airport (very nearby), and the hotel staff was friendly, helpful, and even spoke some English. They provide a basic breakfast in the morning (coffee, eggs, toast, etc.) that is served in a lovely garden courtyard area. The room I had was small but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was updated and modern, and the shower had great water pressure and hot water. The wifi in the room worked very well. The hotel is located in a gated neighborhood, and security is good. I walked about a mile each way every day, and had no problems. Take out food can be delivered in the evenings if you don't want to have to find a restaurant."
30,"The room was clean and well decorated, and the garden was a nice place to have breakfast, but I feel like the room was overpriced. The hotel is very close to the airport and to a night club. There was quite a bit of noise at night."
50,"This was my third time staying at Villa Toscana and each time has been a wonderful experience. The staff is extremely helpful, especially for anyone who struggles with Spanish - they even went so far as to order pizza for us when we let them know what we wanted. The location is in a secure neighborhood 5 minutes from the airport. It is family-run, a great price, a beautiful courtyard and comfortable and clean rooms. Definitely a place we'll continue to frequent on our trips to Guatemala City."
40,We have made travel arrangements with Villa Toscana numerous times over the last several years -- usually associated with mission teams. It is a great value with comparatively quiet surroundings considering it is near the airport. It's proximity to the airport (and on the airport side of major thoroughfares which makes it a clear choice for those who want to be within 5 minutes of the check in counter at the airport and not have to worry about traffic jams on the way). The hotel is conspicuously clean with pleasant and helpful management with well appointed rooms and flat panel TV's. Azucena speaks excellent English and management is very helpful and is able to assist with travel and tour arrangements as well as other issues. Breakfast is complementary with a variety of choices
40,"This is a small hostel with breakfast included and free transportation to the airport.  The staff, some with good English, is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is adequate.  We were waiting for a late flight, so the staff suggested a short trip to an area with museums and local handicraft.  A late stay in a room would have cost the room rate.  The rooms are small but adequate."
30,"Almost new hotel, well designed and great location as it is very close to airport and good restaurants. Room was great even though plumbing had problems that could not be fixed during my 6 day stay.  Staff very courteous. Breakfast ok, dinners were beyond terrible. Hope they fix this. "
50,"The Courtyard Marriott is a comfortable and spacious business hotel located within safe walking distance of a variety of restaurants. The staff are excellent. My only complaint is that there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu of the hotel restaurant, which sometimes forced me to go out when i would have preferred to stay in and get work done. But the breakfast spread is very good."
50,"I just spent two weeks in this beautiful Hotel.  It is brand new and the rooms are quite spacious.  The atmosphere is relaxing and one really feels at home.  The staff is amazing. from Managers to the room cleaning staff, everyone makes you feel at home and always ready to tend to your needs.  After I checked in the first day, I realized that The closet space was limited since I brought a lot of clothes for two weeks.  I talk to the hotel staff and they eventually upgraded me to a suite.  Additionally, the food is great at the restaurant and more affordable than any other hotel restaurant in Zone 10.   I Have visited Guatemala several times in the past 10 years and Stayed in many hotel.  The Courtyard Marriott is now my favorite and I will recommend it to anyone traveling to"
40,"Traveled on business, this hotel is located in the hearty of Zona 10 which is considered very safe, you can walk around alone at night and feel safe. About 15-20 good restaurant at walking distance. Hotel breakfast and Gym is average so giving it 4 star. Rooms are clean and good, although average size. Gym requires more equipment, there is no pool. Basically depends on the price of room."
40,I had an amazing stay at this hotel while I stayed. The room was very nice despite its small living quarters. I only really had one problem while I was here. my laundry was taken for cleaning without my permission and it was a little hectic to get my clothing back before i was scheduled to depart. Other than that I this hotel was great.
40,"I really liked the hotel, in my experience I personally had a comfortable stay, room was very Nice and Clean and best of all hotel was only 10 minutes away from airport and shuttle was provided. The only complaint I have is that front desk customer service agent was not that friendly, was so serious most of the time, wasn't rude but not very outgoing. Other than that everything else was good. "
20,"During my checkout the front desk agent ask me to pay 10 USD because i went just one day to the pool on Sunday. Acoording to their policy she told me that access to the pool was not included in my reservation, since i just went for business.   I ask her to put it in my receipt and charge it to the Company that pay for me for the accomodation. My bill was for USD 1,300 and she refuse to put it in my account and ask me for my credit card.  Very very disappointed"
40,"The sheets or covers on the bed are awful!!! Everyone talks about how heavy and uncomfortable they are.  The room are very over-priced. I like the shower, it is awesome. TV quality is very good. Would stay here again if the prices were lower.  "
40,"The one nice thing about this hotel is the location.  It's with several other hotels and in an area that is heavily patrolled by police and security officers to protect tourists.  Walking the streets in that area, we felt safe.  The breakfast was very good. We did have some issues with the WIFI but did get that resolved.  It was a good place to stay and is attached to the Westin.  The beds were comfortable and good water pressure in the showers as well."
30,"My buddy and I stayed at the Biltmore two times this visit to Guatemala. The first stay was for 2 days 1/8-9. This experience was up to our normal expectations as we have stayed here in years past and have always been pleased. My only comment is that after I knew a day or so prior to arriving I attempted to extend the stay 1 day the previous rate was not offered on the web and the price for the extra day went from  approx $85 to $120. At the desk the clerk would not honor the original days rate. Our second stay 1/13 was the reason for the 3 star rating. We were assigned a room facing the street upon which to hotel faces. Across the street was a night club which played throbbing base music until 3 AM! Ear plugs, pillow over our heads, yoga poses, nor mind control solved the"
50,We are still talking about that great breakfast buffet.  The juice selections are fantastic with imaginative & delicious combinations.  The pools & whirlpools are awesome.  Good location in Zone 9/10 & by airport.
30,"Great location with great breakfast buffet , good gym  Can't have a relaxing time in hotel grounds  unless you buy their food or drinks   Just information , so you know , many of events happening all the time"
50,"Excellent stay, beautiful clean room, comfortable bed, delicious buffet breakfast with lots of variety, excellent service, beautiful lobby, highly recommend this hotel for first and last night in Guatemala as it is very close to the airport "
50,"Arrived and due to last minute changes, I was upgraded to a larger room. The room can not be faulted, large wardrobe, iron, ironing board, robes, slippers, toiletries you expect and more... and the bed was incredible. Shower was a little dissapointing due to bath filling up but the shower in my room on my second stay towards the end of my trip was much better.  Buffet breakfast was great especially with a view of the pool with lots of choice including egg station.  I used the pool and hot tub only disturbed intermittently by planes taking off (Only a few miles from the airport).  Had lunch by the pool, fish and chips... slight lost in translation moment with my fish and chips, which ended up being fish with tortilla chips 🤦🏽‍♀️  I should also mention I was deserted by my tour"
50,This hotel is located very convenient for fast access and movement throughout the city of Guatemala. With almost fast access it's a good option if you have no transport and due to high traffic its location it's quite alright. Staff is passionate and kind as well as the food options are wide with rooms comfortable and affordable.
50,"Everything was excelent!!! The room clean and beautiful, the breakfast is so delicious, the customer service is the best, it is a very secure and charming place, I travel with my 2 little daughters and this hotel is close to everything!! The zoo, the childrens museum, to my Church, to the airport, etc. And thank you so much because even that I do not ask for the transportation service when we arrive, we call and you immediately send the transportation to pick us up!!! This is more than great!!!"
40,"I stayed 1 night at Villa Toscana in April 2015.  I definitely recommend Villa Toscana for the following reasons: - Location – The hotel is literally a 5 minute taxi ride from the airport and yet, importantly, it is a nice quiet location and I heard no airport noise. - Security – Like most hotels in Central America and certainly in large cities, the hotel is kept locked and secured at all times and access through the front gate is via intercom.  In addition, Villa Toscana is in a gated neighbourhood with one regular access point in/out which is manned by a guard 24/7. - Reception – The two staff with whom I interacted during my stay were very polite, kind and extremely helpful. - Rooms – my room and bathroom were well appointed, clean and extremely comfortable.  Hot water was"
40,"I wanted a place to stay close to the airport where I actually had a nice sized bed.  I paid a lot for it, by Guatemala standards, but appreciated the comfort and the free, fast wifi. They provided me with a bag breakfast in the morning since I had an early flight and promptly brought me to the airport which is essentially walking distance away."
40,Excellent Service From Azucena and Sergio.  Good breakfast and very pleasant garden. Very good taxi service from airport to hotel.  Ask for Elmer's taxi service.  The location is perfect because 5 minutes from airport.  Not fancy but friendly and reasonable.  Good value for the price
50,"Very secure. Quiet, gated neighborhood.  Near the airport (less than 5 minutes).  Perfect place to stay the night before a flight out of the Guatemala City Airport.  Clean, serviceable rooms.  Complimentary breakfast; if you are leaving before 6:30 a.m., they will give you a juice box and granola bar.  Complimentary shuttle to the airport (but $7.00 U.S. to the military hangar for flights to Tikal).  Comfortable and clean common areas, including a living/dining room with a nice garden out back.  Complimentary wi-fi.  The front desk person---Sergio---was there both nights we stayed.  He is friendly, handles the guests well (many questions), speaks excellent English, and is very accommodating.  My friend received a reminder e-mail while we were in Tikal regarding our ground"
50,"I love how this hotel was furnished and decorated, very modern and stylish. The staff treats everyone as a premium guest. Located at the center of Guatemala City you have great dinning choices at walking distance. Can't wait to be there next week."
50,"My second visit at this beautiful hotel as having the opportunity to walk many attracting places. Hotel provided us transportation and from pick up to the return, they treat us as family. Emilio, Alonzo, Manuel and Mynor yool were very friendly and they provided us an excellent service the whole time!"
50,"Our three night stay was planned around meeting family between Holidays.  Perfect choice !  Best location in Zona Viva/Hotel-Restaurant area of City. The Courtyard would be welcome in Barcelona, or Zurich, or Berlin. Very accommodating staff, and well-appointed, brand new lodging. The design and decoration was first-rate, and included a 30' wall design which was part Alexander Calder, and part vibrant triangles of designs inspired by indiginous weavings  by Guatemalan weavings   It was a please to behold, and lent a Barcelona/ Gaudi sensation to the hotel.  This hotel reflects both cultures very honestly"
50,"We stayed only one night and we arrived very late in Guatemala City. We got the free airport shuttle pickup and the driver was there holding our name card. It was about a 10 minute drive from the airport to the hotel. Checkin was also very quick and smooth. They kept the restaurant open just for us even though it was Christmas eve. Food selections and taste were very good. In the morning, we took the 4:30am shuttle back to the airport. Staff were very friendly, spoke good English and were also helpful. A very short but nice stay."
50,"Great Staff, Attentive Service, Really love the rooms, Love the new Courtyard Marriott Layout, great flow, feng shui...Great location close to great restaurants, shopping etc...  Will definitely make this my one of my favorite hotels to stay in Guatemala"
40,"We spent two nights at the Biltmore, which is in a very good neighbourhood of Guatemala City in November 2016. We were upgraded to a suite on the top floor, because the hotel was packed due to a bank event. The event was an extremely noisy one, which went on all night just outside our window. We slept with the TV on which went some way to drowning out the noise and we were very tired... just as well! The room was spotlessly clean and extremely large and comfortable, with an enormous flat screen TV and a small kitchen. The bathroom was small but everything worked perfectly and the cosmetics were nice. Lovely bed and pillows. The carpet and furnishings were a bit worn but no complaints really. Nice breakfast and good location, close to some excellent restaurants. A good choice for"
30,"Big clean rooms, with a desk, very friendly staff. Breakfast has some opportunities, as there are only two people to serve, clean and arrange the tables, so usually there are no plates, no glasses,  some food is finished, and have to look for the guys in the kitchen. Depending on the rate, you have to pay the internet (USD 15 for 24 hours), something I can not understand for this kind of hotels. It is located very close to restaurants, and shopping malls, and for USD 107day, you can use the gym and pool of the  camino real. They have free shuttle from/to airport every 30 minutes."
40,"Great price benefit. Highly recommended for business stays. Breakfast is varied and staff are highly accessible. No problem for families. Hotel interconnected with lobby to the areas. Worth the stay, good pricing"
40,"The rooms were clean, comfortable size, comfortable beds. However, I was in room 2228 on the second floor and from 9pm onwards, every night, I had music booming in my room. I wasn't sure if it came from the courtyard of Westin, the neighbour hotel, or the discotheque across the street. Make sure to ask for another room.   Quite a few good restaurants around. Safe neighborhood. Close enough from airport and airport shuttle service is great. There is a running path just a block away. Friendly staff  Breakfast was good. Fresh fruit, yogurt, granola. Unfortunately NO fresh juice and breads and cheeses were purely processed. Pastries looked too glazed.   Wifi is not free."
10,This Hotel Charge For WiFI. In my Entire Experience Of Sales And Marketing(Approx 15Years) Travelled All Across The Globe almost 72 Countries never found a Single Hotel who Charge for WiFi. But This is the first hotel where i Paid money for WiFi Internet Use.(They Charge 15$ Per day for WiFi).The People Who work at Reception they dont care for the guest they just want the money and even they will not reply you properly.
50,American Airlines had a plane issue and put us all in the Barcelo Hotel and It was Great! They also provided meal coverage and shuttle to airport. This was a easy and great experience to get stuck in Guatemala.
20,"Shuttle service was terrible, front desk service was horrible, resolution to a problem is poor. The only positive was the room was clean, cleaning and restaurant restaurant very friendly and courteous."
40,"The all inclusive Premium Level is better value for money than the average rooms. Confirm prices of massages and services, they can be unreliable. Kids are not allowed in the jacuzzi, so that's an issue."
40,We ended up at this hotel because the Santa Teresita hotel somehow did not have a room for us on the second night of a stay booked 3 months previously. So we had to find alternative accommodations for the last night of our Guatemala vacation. It turned out to be a great hotel.Good clean rooms .great breakfast.
50,I am a return customer  the Hotel is on the best location if you are looking to stay after landing or if you want to stay close to the airport the food is amazing and the staff are the best  the rooms are exceptional with a nice view  
40,"On arriving the first time from Cuba via San Salvador, late, tired & hungry, having ordered from the menu online, we find no food for us, & too late to get anything. Ob we weren't impressed. However our next visit a week later, was much better. We ordered from the menu & although not cheap, the food is very good & way too much. I had the Xochitl soup it was amazing, & the fried rice is also very good. My suggestion is to order half of what you think you will need. Both times we had the same room, the lamp didn't work so we changed it with the other lamp. Hot water was fine. On our first visit we enjoyed breakfast, the second, as we were flying out early, they gave us a juice & cereal bar. First visit we were too late for the free P/U, but as we were flying to Tikal on the 2nd"
10,"my mistake was reading the reviews of this as a hotel instead of delving into the meaning of the word ""hostal"".  We checked into 2 rooms at around 8 p.m , our flight was at 7 a.m the next morning. Small room, narrow bed, no phone, threadbare towel, no hot water in faucet in my room, no hot water in shower in daughters room.  A sliver of soap, no drinking glass for a pill, . And a rate of over $60. For each room, I though hostels were inexpensive!  And a 6% charge for using a credit card. Nice young man who works there but otherwise a bad mistake.  I would not recommend this to anyone. Five minutes away is Guatemala City with many better hotels! As I said, my mistake."
50,"Hostal is in a quiet, safe gated section of the city.  Rooms nice sized; one on the second floor has a balconey which looks out on a small but lovey back yard.  Snacks and take-out dining options available.  They also sell good quality wine/beer right there."
30,"We only stayed here because we had an early flight leaving GUA. This place is not worthy of its lofty reviews. The only good thing I could think of was that you were safe in the B&B and the breakfast was not too bad.  1. It is ridiculously close to the airport. Great for getting to/from. It goes without saying you need earplugs at night. 2. The rooms are small, uncomfortable but safe. The shower didn't drain properly and they knew they had problems with mosquitos because they gave us a thing to stick into the wall to keep them at bay. 3. I did not leave the property. It is in a gated community and I was too scared to leave while it was dark. The staff can help you find food from nearby fast food joints if desired, although overpriced. 4. Plus one for being much cheaper than our"
50,"If you want an Australian standard motel that's neat with everything you need stay here. Price is good and you can't hear the planes, food isn't close but that have a menu that's delivered and it's decent. For the price it's more then good enough."
50,"I (lifetime Platinum) always try to stay at Marriott or SPG properties where I can  and this time around it was not an exception.  Though I stayed only for a day at this Courtyard but the level of service by the staff and the overall experience was second to none.  I checked in around 10AM (early check in), they upgraded us to Suite also they let me checkout at 4PM as my flight was at 2AM the next morning.  Front desk staff was very polite and extremely helpful.  I would recommend this hotel for business and family vacations."
40,"I stayed one night in this beautiful hotel.  The lobby and Common areas are extremely comfortable and they gather the essence of the Guatemalan soul (Pictures, design, style, handicrafts) The Rooms: They have an exquisite design. They are practical, elegant and very cozy. (My 4-year-old boy enjoyed it a lot:  The bed, the huge TV, the practical sofa-bed) The location: It is really convenient to most popular sites in Zona 10 (free transfer from the airport) Staff: They are impressively kind and gentle. Juan Pablo (front desk) helped me a lot and made our stay unforgettable. I highly recommend this hotel for the modern, and demanding business person. I don't think this can be considered a family hotel but I am sure that for pleasure or fun you will have an amazing stay at"
50,"This Courtyard is not your typical Courtyard-More like a Marriott branded hotel. I had reason to check in three separate times in November. The first was for a twenty person meeting that I arranged through Carol Blanco who did a wonderful job in making sure all our needs were met. The break service at the meeting was done well with folks there to make sure it all went well.  The front desk folks are smiling and attentive to your needs, including the doorman/shuttle driver at 4 am on Tuesday, the 20th, who made sure we had a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  As a property that is brand new I have to say that it is very well managed and staffed by professionals."
50,"Being Platinum for life at Marriott, I stayed for the first time in the Courtyard of Guatemala and the experience was great. Whenever I go to Guatemala that is my hotel. The rooms are very neat and clean and the attention of the employees is first"
50,"Being Marriott Gold, I usually tend to go all Marriott. This has been my favorite spot so far!  The amazing staff from checking in, to the bar team to Nancy the sweet and wonderful manager who helped us with a huge travel issue are absolutely amazing!  Completely blew my mind how caring and supportive the staff has been with our family!  We will continue to be a Marriott family with visits like this with exemplary staff showing great love when traveling afar.  Thank you Nancy and your amazing team!  "
40,"clean hotel, and centrally located. many good restaurants around. connected with the elegant Westin hotel through a service entrance, it allows you to take advantage of the westin services. I can find one only withdraw:coffee and snacks are not available if you have to leave reallyearlyas in my case, however:recommended!"
50,"I stayed at Hotel Biltmore twice when I was flying in and out of Guatemala City.  The rooms were lovely, clean, and comfortable; breakfast was fantastic, and the staff was VERY helpful in either English or Spanish."
40,"There is a lot of room for improvement in the type of amenities you offer in the bathrooms.  Hotels of your category offer  much more than just soap and shampoo.  Additionally, you are wasting too much water if you don't provide a way to close the drain in the bathroom sink. "
50,"It has all the mod cons that you need, the rooms are comfortable, they have breakfast buffet included. For $10 you can use a five star hotel facilities. They have a lounge bar, great bed and pillows and the front desk staff it's friendly "
40,"I think the price / quality ratio is OK. Breakfast is included and quality is also OK if not spectacular. Location is good. However, Internet access is not included and Hotel wanted to charge me 15$ per day for WiFi. This is not OK on this day and age. I am never returning to this property just based on this."
40,"Great service and the staff is nice.  Breakfast Buffet is nice but the rest.. I recommend Donde Mike, Donde Joselito, Estancia which are pretty close to Barcelo.  And I tried both the suite and normal room, and the bed in normal room can be pretty short for people above 6 ft.  "
50,It is a clean and friendly hotel.  I also enjoy the Gym.  It has a large variety of equipment to exercise. The hotel is located in a nice area in the city and has multiple restaurants in a close proximity.
50,"Great hotel that connects both to airport and bus station (Pulmmature). On our trip, we went to Antigua and Chichicastenango. We also traveled to El Salvador. All of these trips were possible because hotel Barcelo is located conveniently to airport and bus station. "
50,Excellent stay at the Barcelo. Would stay there again the next time I am in Guatemala. The staff was exceptional and very caring. The room was very comfortable and clean.  The view of the city was breathtaking!
50,Very comfortable accommodations with delicious food service and excellent amenities.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  It was a nice place to relax with our family.  We would highly recommend this hotel.
50,"Great hotel, I enjoyed every minute, the staff are extremely friendly, the hotel is clean, cozy, organized, and the staff are ready to help you! The breakfast is delicious, and the restaurant is very nice! The hotel has a good location! I’ll come back for sure!"
40,"The most amazing thing about this hotel is the extremely friendly staff.  At the front desk, Ms. Molina, Johnny de Paz, Rodolfo Mejía, are all fabulous.  The maids are extraordinary.  Upon my final day, I received a farewell card from Dalila, Andrea and William, inviting me to return.  I haven't seen that at five-star hotels!  Andrea in the dining room was very helpful and friendly.  The hotel is brand new, so everything works welll.  The beds are heavenly, as are the pillows.  Medium-sized comfortable rooms with a big TV, nice sitting area with couch, very comfortable desk, safety box, mini-fridge and modern lighting.  The rooms are also very quiet.  The downside: one big, loud lobby, with no separate areas for front desk, business center, dining area and bar; with tiled floors"
30,"I’m a platinum Marriott member,  was disappointed that breakfast not included.  Hotel new, clean, quiet.  Small gym. Good location. Nothing fancy basic hotel and other options close by, I usually prioritize Marriott however having stayed at other hotels in Guatemala City this one would not warrant a repeat visit.     Staff was friendly, Security good, which is important.  Basic accommodations. "
50,"Great Location, Brand new hotel, great layout for meetings or casual visit. Highly recommended. Front desk personnel was great. Breakfast was good. Gym was good. I will definitely come back for business or personal"
40,"This is one of the nicest  hotels we stayed in Central America. The rooms are cozy, great bed, linens, pillows and towels. The TV has Netflix and a great selection of channels. The staff is very friendly, there is no room service and the food is not very good but since it has a great location you can walk to great restaurants with all kind of different cuisines, Guatemala City is famous for that.  "
50,"Excellent little B&B just minutes from the airport in a gated neighborhood. Very helpful staff. We had to leave before the usual breakfast time, so the young man brought a tray of coffee, juice  and a granola bar to our room.  Pleasant backyard where we ordered dinner to be delivered and enjoyed a bottle of wine purchased from the hostel.  Airport noise was not a problem.  Will definitely stay there again"
40,"This hotel came through for us in many ways. We had to cancel a room in a rather ""last minute"" fashion, and the owner was very understanding. We speak NO Spanish, and had our daughter call them to send a cab to the bus station to pick us up late at night when we did go. Cabbie was friendly, English-speaking and professional. The gentleman receptionist was about the most courteous and hospitable person we encountered on our 12 day trip through Guatemala and Honduras. He ordered food for us just before the deadline for closing, carried our bags to our room, scheduled a cab for our 5:30 am ride to the airport, and knocked lightly on our door at 5:30 to help us bring our bags down to the awaiting cab. One doesn't get better service! We stayed in the upstairs bedroom with balcony."
50,"Highly recommend Hostal Villa Toscana for first or last night near GUA.  We arrived, had friends bring us to the hotel where we were warmly greeted by the staff.  We were flying up to Flores on the early flight, so wanted to stay close to the airport.  Our room and bathroom was large, clean and comfortable.  Of course, there is some noise from arriving or departing aircraft, but that is to be expected when you are only 4 minutes or so from GUA.  There is a lovely garden patio area for meals or reading.  We ordered dinner which was brought in from a restaurant and enjoyed a relaxing evening.  The taxi arrived right on time at 5:00 am and we were given a small breakfast to go.  For pricing, convenience and safety, I don't think you can do any better than this!"
30,"Everything said before is true: it is safe, clean, and the staff is friendly. It is not a 4 or 5 star accommodation, but it serves its purpose. We were able to enjoy a dinner, (which is brought in from an outside restaurant), in a pleasant garden. The convenience of printing the boarding pass the evening before was very nice. The wake-up call  (4 am) included a light breakfast and the ride to the airport was right on time. We did not feel comfortable leaving the establishment to walk, but we felt very safe. It is the place to stay when flying from Guatemala City."
50,"I just had an amazing trip to Guatemala, I went there with my two girls and we just love this so charming hostal so much, everything was so perfect, the room was  comfortable, clean and like I said so charming, quiet, the bathroom as well,  the people who work there was so helpful and so nice!!!! Once I ask for tortillas instead of bread, because I prefered tortillas, and I have tortillas every day since!!! Wowwww!!!! The breakfast was so delicious and we were sitting down close to the beautiful garden!!! What can be more comfortable?   It is located in a very safe area, it is really easy to take the bus outside, it is really close to restaurants, the children's museum, the zoo, etc.   And one thing I more than grateful was that I didn't ask for a Taxi to picked us from the"
30,"We had a family reunion and had reserved a suite for my wife and me. The front clerk charged me and gave us our key. For our surprise when we enter the room was a double. Went back to the front desk and asked the lady that she had gave us the wrong room, she ruddly said that it was the only room that was available and I rather take or leave it. Very unprofesional staff."
40,"I stayed here overnight to break my travel from Australia to Puerto Quetzal so I guess my views are compressed.  On arrival, processed by very friendly and competent staff who spoke good English. Room was very clean and modern décor.  Good bed and pillows.  Hotel appears to be in a good location and reasonably safe. Breakfast was good but you need to get there early for the hot breakfast as it appears that once gone it is not replenished. Xtra payment required to use pool and gym and payment required for Wi-Fi which is quite expensive. Overall, it did what I required."
40,Nice and clean hotel with a good breakfast included. Ask for a room with a hotel with a view otherwise you will have a view to a building. Only thing is that you have to pay extra y you want to go the pool or gym.
50,"This is a very nice, very clean hotel with excellent food and good service. It was a refreshing experience at the end of a very long and busy trip to Guatemala. It is located close to other shops and dining."
50,"Fantastic location! Great menu for room service! Shared amenities with Westin:) (for a fee you can use pool and workout room). Walking distance to delicious food! One odd thing is that breakfast ends at 11:00, technically, but when the food is gone, it is not replaced. Go early if you want the hot items! Cozy beds, great air conditioning!! You won't be disappointed!"
50,"Great facility and the staff was professional and very service oriented, made our first time in Guatemala a pleasant time. Definitely we will recommend this hotel to our family and friends back at home."
40,Reliable standards and convenient to the airport and to the archeological museum and zoo. Friendly helpful staff. A great nights sleep. Enjoyed the Japanese restaurant. Clean rooms and good air conditioning. 
50,"I’d like to say that every single one of your staff is great, Front Desk, Security, bellmen, hosekeepers, maintenance, etc.  Everything I needed I got it in minutes.  Lounge on the 9th floor provides excellent food and drinks. "
40,"Very luxurious hotel  Friendly staff and always eager to help  Breaks st was good  Some of the dinners were excellent while other felt like were canned meals    for example, our last meal was chicken soup and I was expecting homemade style, what I got was more of canned soup."
50,"awesome hotel, super clean, perfect location near plenty or restaurants for fine dining and fast food and night life.  excellent breakfast with so many options . the pool water is warm so you can swim even if its a little chill  outside.  the hot tub was very large size so you don't feel overcrowded and the pool area opens very very early.  "
40,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this hotel is brand new, modern and centrally located. The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable, and the wifi worked better than in the office I was working from. The gym is on the small side but clean and has the essentials. The breakfast buffet was small, but had a great variety, including healthy choices (the fruit smoothies are the best!). My only complaint on the breakfast was the coffee; you should have better coffee in Guatemala! The staff was nice, but my only complaint is that no one seemed to have the correct information on the airport schedule. I was told that I have to go to the airport at least 4 hours prior to my flight, but that the airport did not open until 4am (I had a 6am flight). The staff didn't seem to know"
50,"We booked this hotel with Marriott point.  It did not need much point. Marriott always treats guest using point as VIP.  We got a great room at high floor.  Once in California, we got a  suite. This place not not a Courtyard by a scale Marriott with wonderful staff.  Most of them speak English very well. Staff are eager to help.  The ATM does not honor my ATM network.  The ATM at Holiday Inn does but do not dispense Quetzal (only USD).  Since we had to leave at dawn, got panicked.  The shuttle driver found a currency exchange place for us.  What a relief! Everything seems perfect but we did not have time to enjoy. Next time we visit, this will be our first choice of lodging."
50,"I couldn't believe this was a Courtyard. I frequently stay in CY as a Marriott Platinum....and this is by far the best CY anywhere, and rivals 'full size' hotels. In true Courtyard style, the rooms are a little smaller, and there are 2 elevators. But the lobby is unbelievable. As is the service....the Staff are friendly and helpful, going out of their way to help. The restaurant has a good, cheap buffet (10USD) and meals throughout the day, unlike other CY properties. And they have a large waitstaff even wearing suits! Housekeeping even folded my laundry and organized my bathroom every day. The location is great, close to many good restaurants. The only drawback to being in the center of the city is the noise in the evening, so light sleepers might not be happy; however, it"
50,This is a brand new ultra modern hotel situated in the heart of the city.  I stay in many Courtyard by Marriott hotels but not like this one. In addition the service was over the top. Work or pleasure this is the place to stay. 
50,"This place opened in March and I was very impressed. After staying at a variety of local hotels over the past 20 years I would rate this one amongst the best. It's cafe and bat area is nice, and I definitely recommend it for breakfast or picking up coffee in the morning.  For business there is plenty of reasonable parking onsite and plenty of restaurants within walking distance. "
30,"We spent the night here prior to an early flight out of Guatemala. The hotel was secure, the room was clean, and the staff was very good. The hotel has a nice garden and we ordered food from an outside restaurant through the hotel, and had a nice meal in the garden. Our wake up call was prompt and we were given a box breakfast to go since we had to leave at 5:00 AM. The transportation to the airport was right on time. The hotel was exactly what we expected based on reading other reviews."
50,"Convenient location (2mins to the airport); lovely, super neat walled garden; comfortable beds & bed linens; warm/welcoming staff (most of which have excellent command of English, also when emailing).  A highly recommended B&B!"
50,"I was pleasantly surprised by this unassuming hostel only a 5min walk from the airport. The staff were absolutely stunning. I booked on line from my home country and received an email back from them within an hour. I arrived in Guatemala and was warmly welcomed by their professional staff. No request was to big or too small,  my room was excellent, considering that they are so reasonably priced. Obviously being so close to the airport, it can get noisy, BUT that's what one should expect anywhere in the world being so close to incoming aircraft, however the location is central and perfect for a short stay. The hostel uses a specific taxi service, and the owner of that small enterprise was also only to keen to help, suggest and advise on were to go and were not to go. All in all,"
50,"I stayed at the Villa Toscana after a long overnight flight to Mexico and then on to Guatemala, and this is what you call a depressurisation from the stress of travel.   The hostal is located in a guarded neighbourhood behind some gates and I felt safe here given that Guatemala City isn`t exactly a safe place. The big plus is that it is also located very close to the airport.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and there is a garden at the back. You can also order food and drink so you don`t have to worry about leaving the hostal. I ordered a Chinese meal with an orange juice for lunch which filled me right up that I saved more for dinner. Free internet is also available.  The lady at the desk was nice and she was helpful with everything I needed. I believe she can also arrange"
50,We couldn't have picked a better place to stay near the airport.  We were arriving from Flores at 9pm and leaving for the USA at 7am the next morning.  The staff at the Hostal Villa Toscana were wonderful.  They arranged free pick-up at the airport (waiting for us with a sign) and brought us to their hotel (only a 2 minute drive) where they coordinated the delivery of a late night dinner which we ate in the dinning room.  I requested coffee before our departure at 5am and it was ready and waiting for me in the dining room when I awoke (at no charge).  Our trip back to the airport was easy and timely.  Our hostesses were accommodating at every turn and made a very quick turn-around as comfortable as possible.  Thank you!
30,"This hotel is located in a great and SAFE area in Guatemala City. My office is just a few steps away, so this is the #1 reason to choose this hotel. Staff are friendly. My room was clean but located in front of a local disco with loud music until 2-3am, this was not a problem for me, but could be for others who have problem sleeping. Good internet. Average buffet breackfast. I will stay again on my next trip."
30,"Overall the hotel well, but there is evidence of lack of maintenance, remote control of the TV did not work. The rest of the hotel looks good and comfortable including food area. I visited many times Guatemala and every time I choose Biltmore Hotel."
40,"This hotel nicely balances price and luxury. It is the step child of the pricey Westin next door, but is surprisingly classy. Free full breakfast with Guatemalan staples (eggs, beans, plantains, etc) as well as waffle maker, three juices, fresh fruit and pastries. Very friendly staff and free airport shuttle. On our second stay, they offered us free wifi which we took them up on. Felt well taken care of. The hotel would get 5 stars if not for the wifi charge and also $10 per person charge to use the pool at the Westin. Great location near a mall and the obelisk park."
50,"Everytime a visit the hotel, I have an excellente experience. Custom service is very good, location, room service, breakfast, nice working team. Every time I travel to Guatemala my first option is Biltmore Express."
30,"Good service, but I think wi-fi should be free and I experience problems during breakfast of food running out and no replacement. The hotel is clean, well mantained and confortable.      I would recommend with restrictions. "
50,"Excellent location if you need to stay near the airport.  Very friendly, clean and easy ride to and from the airport provided by Elmer... a very reliable and friendly personal driver.  We will stay there again in the future."
40,"I am currently at the end of my two night stay at Villa Toscana and have been so thankful for this peaceful escape from the chaos of the city.  The Villa is located in a gated residential community which provides a much different feel than staying in a commercial location. Those who like to walk out the door and have restaurants and shopping at their doorstep will not like this establishment, however the staff are more than happy to arrange transportation to any location you desire.  They are also on hand to answer any questions or concerns that you might have and are fluent in both Spanish and English. A choice of breakfasts are included in the room rate as well as transport to the airport.  Rooms vary in size, however all are tastefully decorated and extremely clean.  The only"
40,"Great service & excellent installations  Too confortable can't get out of the bedroom :)  Inn only for a overnight , transportation & breakfast spot on... Highly recommended. . Only two minutes drive from the airport. "
40,"This place is well-located, well-protected, clean and attractive. No frills but perfect for a stopover with an early flight. Minutes from the airport, ride included with a snack in hand if there's no time for breakfast. The hotel staff is courteous and helpful. We would choose it again."
50,We really enjoy Villa Toscana. The staff is welcoming and accommodating and the rooms are beautiful. Their shuttles are reliable and they always offer juice and snacks to take to the airport if our flight requires leaving before breakfast is served. I have already booked a stay there for the final night of our next trip.
50,"Great hotel in every way: location, staff, service, facilities, food, cleanliness. I highly recommend it. It's definitely the best Courtyard I have ever stayed in. The hotel is brand new so the rooms, lobby and decor are very modern and in great taste. They provide a shuttle for free transportation to the airport."
50,"Overall the staffs are very educated and friendly always with a smile. They make us feel at home. To mention few Rooms Manager Soler, bellman's, shuttle Driver who picked us up at he Airport and restaurant staff are awesome. They went above and beyond for our entire stay!!"
50,"Excellent service,clean accommodation and common areas. Excellent location, near restaurants and shopping.  I recommended to others for business or pleasure.  Love the customer service. Thank to all the personnel to make my stay very comfortable and nice in guatemala "
50,"This was my second visit to this city where I got this hotel opened only 3 months back. The staff treats you like at home , rooms are spacious ,neat and clean , food and breakfast up to the mark. It has all the qualities of a modern hotel where you would like to stay again and again. Apart from the hotel it has all the good restaurants with in short vicinity. On room availability I would always like to stay only here when ever I am next in Guatemala."
40,"This is a very modern and updated Courtyard Marriott. It's in the center of the city in Zona 10. You have access to a lot nearby. The price is reasonable. The rooms are new, clean and comfortable. They have a huge lobby with a bar and restaurant. This isn't a destination hotel but if you are looking for a place to stay while you are in Guatemala City, this will do nicely."
50,"We were particularly impressed with the incredibly comfortable beds and the amazing breakast. A huge variety of fresh, tasty produce was available from the breakfast buffet. I can't comment on the immediate vicinity of the hotel as we stayed only as part of a connection between flights. "
50,The hotel iocation is close to the airport.  The staff is excellent and friendly.  Hotel has great facilities and the swimming pool is big and wide with clean water. The breakfast spread is also super with a lot of variety.
50,"Perfect hotel for a quick in and out of Guatemala City. Close to the airport with all the amenities. Many restaurant choices. I wouldn't walk around the neighborhood, but there is plenty to do inside the hotel."
30,"The staff was friendly, and the location was convenient. The hotel is old, needs to be refreshed, and it lack a wide selection of foods. It should offer different cuisine, and options that are sensitive to allergies."
50,"Exceptional location, excellent service, variety of food selection from various restaurants, and there are employees who make the experience most satisfying. The pool patio is a great way to begin an evening prior to dinner.  One can choose the sports bar and grill or from the 2 more formal dinning rooms."
10,"USD 15 per 24 of internet .......please... that , s the main reason Why i leave I had to be three days for business at Guatemala , one night at biltmore Was enough to Run ! Dangerous bathrooms, no restaurant, poor breakfast . At less there are moré hotels at GT city to save the trip"
30,"My husband and I spent the night at this hotel, which has no actual parking space. When you get there, you have to get in through the Camino Real Hotel, and if you don't have a key, or a staff member with you, you can't go through to the Biltmore.  One of the elevator wasn't working, but since it was on the first floor already, it kept opening, but not going up. And the other one wouldn't come down.   The next morning we left very early for the airport and we didn't have the chance to have the breakfast. The person at the front desk charged the wrong card and when I let him know so he just answered ""What do we do now?"" we were late for our flight so I just decided to leave it at that.  On our way in, a staff member of Camino Real accompanied us all the way to the lobby, on our"
10,"The front desk staff were great, the hotel in general is average and not cheap, the breakfast was terrible! We get there at 8:30 am there was no juice and most of the food was cold or empty, i ask the waiter if they can put more food and juice and he said I have to wait 30 min and I ask for water and because juice had run out and he want us to pay extra for the water"
40,The Biltmore is linked to the Westin Camino Real which I guess is a top class hotel I could not afford to stay in. The Biltmore is very clean with good size rooms and excellent room service and modest daily rate. Breakfast bar has a good range of food although sometimes it could be fresher as food sits there for about 3 or 4 hours. Coffee and muffins there all day. Tiny bar which no one uses but your room card gets you into the back door of the Westin which has large bar and restaurant at appropriate prices. Also gym and pool which you get charged for. Location is good for airport and Transmetro buses into city. Plenty of choice locally of moderately priced restaurants.
50,"Courteous staff, comfy rooms, excellent food!  i particularly liked that there are two restaurants which offers an informal and a formal setting to meet guests preference.  also having a gift shop, bar, barber and salon allows you easy access to such amenities!  "
40,We stayed for three separate nights in this very comfortable place located very close to the airport. The rooms are basic but neat and clean. The staff is very friendly and eager to please. The breakfast is delicious and served in the garden if you wished. The transport we required to catch the bus for Tikal or the plane at the airport was pre-arranged by the hotel and operated by very polite drivers. In nutshell it is gem of a place.
50,"Great place to stay for the airport. Very welcoming, lovely comfortable beds with good bed linen and pillows. Hot showers, good breakfast. Arranged transport was very prompt. The best place we have stayed in Guatemala in our 8 years of travelling here. Reasonably priced as well."
50,"This is a fantastic place to stay when flying in or out of Guatemala City. Fantastic, friendly service, 2 minutes from the airport, a lovely garden and beautiful, comfortable rooms. Great value. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else."
40,"after trying to get a room in all of the, ""bigs"" in the 10th zone ,all were sold out our agent recommened this place. we pulled up to non-descript metal gates . when we walked through the door, wow we were schocked! it was terrific! we had a double with ensuite bathroom, great , hot! shower after three days in the jungle near tikal. staff was great breakfast delicious and beautiful outdoor garden breakfast area. value was, can't be beat. it is literally right at the entrance/exit of the airport in a gated community but a taxi was just a few minutes wait away. having stayed here, I do not think I would ever choose to stay at any of the bigs again room was spacious and clean loved this place!"
50,"I can’t think of, nor have I experienced a better place to stay near the airport in Guatemala City.  The staff is friendly, the rooms are lovely, and very comfortable.  While the breakfast is simple, it is good.  I have stayed there twice now, and both times, I had the same experience.  Given the short shuttle to the airport, the fact that both breakfast and the ride to the airport are no extra charge, and the internet is free for a price of about $40, how could you go wrong.  Oh, and the entire facility is immaculately clean.  Given the other places I have stayed in both Guatemala City and in the rural areas, this was like a palace!"
50,"I am very happy that finally at Guatemala, you could have the option of a Courtyard.  The hotel its very nice and you could easily note that they are trying to give the service that had distinguished this chain for many years.  I think they have to improve the quantity of people at the front desk. I arrive at 11 pm, with a big group of people and was not until 15 mins later that the other desk support person arrive. The same situation happened with the check out.  That other detail is the TV. Cable guide drive you thru a big list of channels that you don't access and also could not pay to see them... "
40,"The hotel is very well located when visiting Guatemala city for short stays. The rooms are clean and with good spaces. The attention from the staff is their strongest attribute. The only weak points are: the quality of the food is average without beeing bad! and wish the¿y have room service, somedays you return late and tired and they dont have this service."
40,"I´m Marriott PlatElite so this would be my first port of call when seeking accommodation. It's a nice new hotel with a modern feel. I particularly like the main lobby area with lounge space, cafeteria and dining area. Great staff, nice rooms with the one main limitation being the lack of a pool which is going to be a problem when I come on longer visits. Need somewhere to relax and take a dip."
50,"I had the chance to stay at the Marriot Courtyard in Guatemala City, it is a new hotel in the city with great environment It is located in place where it is easy to move by foot to other places  The environment at the hotel is great, lobby a social area with elegant and minimalist style"
50,"Stayed here for 2 nights with other foreign visitors and had very positive experience in this brand new hotel, at great location with excellent high end rooms, and perfect internet in room and lobby. Design is very modern with high end material and decent breakfast options. I highly recommend this hotel for any business trip to Gmala.  Surrounding area also pretty safe for quick stroll or for outside dining.  High five.."
40,"We were upgraded and ended up in a duplex, which was huge, convenient and clean. Internet worked perfectly all over the hotel. Rooms could do with an update though. Staff friendly and efficient.   As there was a big conference going on, the dining had to take place in a not so appealing room as held for the breakfast. That room didn't add to a nice ambiance.  Hotel's pretty close to the history and archeological museum (and zoo). Down town Guatemala City takes about 15-20 minutes by car.  Price/quality okay"
50,Great place to stay staff and personal all over the hotel are very friendly and helpful. Get the premium rooms lots come with it can't go wrong. Could rent a your car and book trips to different place around the city
50,"Excellent place to stay with a great variety of services, including airport shuttle, saloon, massage, pool, gym, souvenir shopping, etc. Good restaurant, a buffet that rules! Rooms are very clean, taxi cabs available and good attention by staff."
50,"Spend a week in Chichi without phone, internet or TV ( on purpose). Spend my last night in Guatemala in the Barcelo before flying back to the USA. Very nice hotel made for Western guest. The only down side was 1 of the hotel restaurants, Strikers, the service and food was ok at best.  The rooms at the hotel are nice, clean, comfortable rooms. The lobby, pool and hot tub area are very nice. Everything was updated, clean and modern. The hotel staff was very accommodating. I was traveling with my 80 yr old father and my 15 yr old daughter. The hotel was able to accommodate us with rooms on the same floor. Shuttle service to the airport at 4 am was painless.I plan to stay there again next year when it just my daughter and I. The was dads last trip."
50,Barcelo was the first and last hotel we stayed at on our tour. It was an especially welcome respite on the return when we were tired but new we would have a lovely hot shower in a clean tub and a good meal. The staff was very kind and delivered ginger ale to the room at ten in the evening when my mother’s previous days in the jungle caught up with her. Thank you Barcelo.
40,"Excellent service, all clean, the hotel and the rooms are very quiet you can sleep with out problems, spacious rooms, near of the hotel are many restaurants, even you can go to them walking,  you can choose your food.  And you have the services of the Hotel Camino Real. "
40,"This hotel is attached to the Westin Camino Real, a very fancy, large hotel, one of the most traditional hospitality properties in Guatemala. The Biltmore is more simple, perfect for short business trips. Rooms are clean and comfy, A/C works perfectly, beds are fresh and very comfortable and the best part is the water pressure in the shower, you get a nice massage in every shower, literally. Breakfast is good enough, not great and room service was surprisingly good, I Chad the chicken and shrimp curry and the shrimps with garlic and mushrooms, both great! One nice thing is that for a small price you can use the health club at the Westin which has a nice gym and outdoor's heated pool. You can enjoy the restaurant and other services next door and charge them to your room too."
30,"Nice clean room, hot water didn't work but maintenance fixed it quickly. The only thing that I didn't like I met someone wanted them to meet me in my room and it was a big problem, thought it was odd a real inconvenience."
40," It is a practical and pleasant hotel. The rooms , shared with Camino Real facilities make the resort an eligible site for the job. Only one drawback : the night of my stay I asked a question : the answer of the person at the desk was dismissive and grocera . His response, "" I 'm not going to pay the difference and it is not my problem."" A real slob !! "
30,"I can say this hotel its a good choice for Guatemala City, the only thing I dont like was to be charged extra for Internet, also not a high speed internet, you lost the connection at the lobby where you need to ask for a free coupon for internet no matter they already charge you for that. Breakfast its good and served from 6AM to 10AM. Rooms are average."
30,"This is a new hotel directly across the street from the Radisson in Zona 10. The service was very good and everything was new. The wi-fi was easy to connect to and fast; check-in was quick and easy. No complaints, but the price was high compared to the Holiday Inn which is just down the block and has a pool. Next time I will stay there."
50,"We booked Marriot after a horrible experience at the Radisson just across the street.   The hotel is brand new, light and and spacious. Staff were extremely nice and arranged complementary transfers to and from La Aurora (10min drive without traffic). The transfer from the airport was on time which is not always the case with other hotels. We were also able to leave our large suitcases at the hotel for a night after checkout so as not to carry them all the way to Tikal.     Highly recommend!"
50,"I was really happy with my short stay at this property.  It started well when I called a few hours before I arrived at GUA airport and advised of my flight information. When I arrived, the driver was there waiting beyond customs with a courtyard sign.  The hotel is brand new so it's clean, very modern, and comfortable.  The service is outstanding.  Every interaction I had left me feeling that my business was appreciated.   It is in Zone 10, so it's very safe and convenient to restaurants.  Overall, it was a great stay.   Oh, and Uber is new in Guatemala.  It's a fraction of the price of a taxi and I had no issues over a 2 day stay."
40,"At the time of this review, the hotel has been open for two weeks.   Ample spaces, modern and centrally located.  Rooms are very well designed.  If you are having breakfast at the hotel, be advised that although the cost of the breakfast is comparable to other hotel chains, the menu is quite limited, and therefore pricy for what is offered.   All in all, pleasant stay and will certainly recommend. "
50,"I love this brand new hotel in Guatemala, great location, excellent food, But the best is the staff attention. Definitely this will be my hotel when in Guatemala city. It's just one week since this hotel open but for sure is one of the best options in the city, close to many important places like the international airport, restaurants, entertainment, shopping centers etc. I love it. "
40,"Good acommodation, very close to the airport (2minutes). Staff is really friendly and helpfull, beds are very comfortable and the breakfirst is alright, only the neighbours dog is a bit noisy at night :-)"
30,"The Biltmore is owned by the same company as the WEstin and the two are attached, though the Biltmore entrance is on 15th and the Westin on 14th Calle.  The Biltmore is more of a stripped-down hotel, with no separate dining facilities except for the breakfast area (cost included in room rate).  The rooms are pretty basic, nothing extraordinary, and the bathrooms (at least for the room my family stayed in) are small and only had a shower, not tub.  Like most other hotels in the city, walls are thin so noise comes through.  However, note that your room key will get you access to all of the amenities in the Westin Camino Real, and you only pay $10 more a day for access to the spa/pool.  The room rates are much lower too.  Plus you get the free shuttle to and from the airport that"
50,"This was a great first time experience. The staff was great, polite and discrete. This is a private quiet place and most important safe. A little noise from the airplanes but nothing mayor. The breakfast is good.I really recommend it and definitely will go back on my next trip. The bed was great and the room is clean."
50,"We have stayed here several times over the years and have finally decided to write a review.  Each time, we have stayed in a different room, and we have never been disappointed.  The rooms are always very clean, well maintained, and comfortable for a family of four.    The staff speak enough English to help us with directions or ordering food.  Breakfast is good and hot, and they have lots of filtered water around.   The area is gated off, so if you venture out, be sure you know how to get back in.  This makes it feel very safe as well.   I would not hesitate to stay here on our next trip."
50,The Villa Toscana is a gem for those traveling to Guatemala City. The hostel is literally 4 blocks from the airport and easily walkable.   The facilites were clean and inviting. We were greeted at the door and the registration process went without a hitch.  We all enjoyed a good rest and made use of the free Wifi.  The host even woke up at 4 am to wish us on our way with a granola bar and OJ for our trip.  We will be back!
50,"I've stayed at Villa Toscana 4 or 5 times over the last 3 years, most recently in August 2014. The rooms are charming and well appointed and the staff professional and friendly. I have stayed in the higher end suite and the small, simple single and double rooms - all lovely. There are several nice balcony areas as well. A great value and highly recommended!"
50,"I really liked the hotel, not only the rooms are pretty, they are also very comfortable and will make you feel at home. It really hits the right spots on the things you are gonna need from your hotel room, and the best of all its that its located on a good spot of the city if you wanna go out and get to know the best parts of town."
30,"Front Desk Staff should be better able to explain all the differenct taxes and room rates which seem to vary arbitrarily.  The rooms were clean and modern, but breakfast was average.  Connection to Westin is nice but Biltmore does not give SPG points."
30,"At 110 + taxes per night this is not great value for money... but then again not much is in Guat city if you want something that is not a dive. Charging USD 15 per day for wifi in your room is a bit much though... If you pay an extra USD 10, you can stay at the Westin next door (same owners) and you get the wifi AND access to the pool and gym. Plus, the breakfast service looked WAY better...... need I say more? "
40,I had no complaints with this hotel. The customer service is excellent. You get a full complimentary breakfast. The rooms are quiet. The beds are comfortable. And you pay $60 less per night than the adjoining Westin. Would stay here again.  Be prepared to pay $10 per day for WIFI.
50,"The hotel is well located, has good staff, good dining options and well maintained facilities. I went with my family and we all had a very pleasant stay at Barceló Guatemala. The shuttle tio the airport is a plus. "
50,"Great  Excellent  we love staying  at your hotel   for      10 years.. My husband  more.. I  have been there at least  9 times. thank u..   We love the food,  rooms  hot showers..  service clean   rooms..  all is perfect thank you again."
40,Great service and location. Room presentation was good. Breakfast was good with a lot of variety.  I love the hygiene products they have in the bathroom. I also like that they exchange currency with a decent exchange rate. I will come back!
50,"Beautiful hotel, courteous staff very clean. Family friendly  Three restaurant in the hotel. Close to take a walk around the city to shop or eat. Used the airport shuttle and was very clean and on time .  "
50,"Vas a la ciudad de Guatemala y no puedes dejar de hospedarte en el BARCELO, sencillamente es un excelente hotel.   ***   You go to Guatemala City and you can not stop staying at the BARCELO, it is simply an excellent hotel. "
50,"Brand New Awesome Hotel, right in the heart of the entertainment district. Hotel was 3 days old when we stayed and the service, rooms, food and location we amazing. Prices were excellent and a very friendly staff. See the Bell captain Rudolfo for any needs, he goes way above the norm."
50,"A place where everyone can feel at home and been so far from it!! The people, the weather, the food, And the Barcelo Hotel they will give you the experience of a life time, We loved  everything right from the arrival until our departure from Barcelo Guatemala!!"
30,Typical huge business hotel.  The room was comfortable and clean.  The free shuttle to the airport was appreciated. We took a pass on the over priced menú for breakfast. The location of the hotel in zona 9 is close to a grocery store and other restaurant.
10,This is not even a hotel is old and smelly like a cheap hotel way too expensive I regret my stay in this hotel or called motel old like stuck in the 60s I wish I can get my money back for my 4 day stay there
50,"The Barcelo hotel was wonderful. Clean, spacious. Had some artifacts and history about Jade in the display case. Has a nice restaurant and bar with live music which was wonderful to dance to. The breakfast buffet is incredible with many many choices for delicious food."
40,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Barcelo. The rooms were spacious, and beds very comfortable. Was disappointed that the drapes would not completely close as we had full daylight peeking in at 5:15am. Also disappointed that our towels were not replaced when our wet ones were all grouped together on the floor under the sink. The breakfast buffet was the most bountiful one I've every seen.  Something for everyone. Was very good. Hope to return some day."
20,"Personnel is not kind nor willing to help, I didn't like the service at all. Property it's ok though and also the rooms. Ok breakfast. I would't recommend this hotel. Very dissapointed. I was expecting something a lot better."
40,free airport transfer and bkfst is included .  the staff is very friendly since you are connected to the westin you have access to many amenities not all free but is a great advantage .  internet should be cheaper or free  since it is not great all of the time.  Overall for a great value  Service  and location you can not beat this place  but like many hotels in latam checking in and out is a long term process . 
40,"Biltmore is a great option for business travelers or just for a relaxed weekend away from home,  room service is great and the food both variety and quality are excepcional and one of the best features about this hotel.  I've stayed several times with them over a couple of years and customer service, price for what you get and rooms are always good! would only suggest a quality check for the breakfast buffet , which is far from the great choices and service you get from room service . "
30,"This hotel offers a fairly average experience. It appears to be oriented more toward the short-stay business traveller. Rooms, food, staff, amenities and services were all hit and miss. Overall the rooms and hotel were clean but a little tired looking. The location is good so you'll find yourself within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. If you are entering or exiting Guatemala and are looking for a reasonably priced short stay I couldn't recommend against this hotel but you won't find a superior property here."
40,From the moment we came until we left we had great service. Our room was very nice and we really enjoyed the comfortable bed. Only thing I found not satisfactory was charging $15.00 dollars a night for wifi. In this day and age most people expect hotels to offer it for free. Our complimentary breakfast was very good all the fruit was fresh and the coffee was great 
50,"Convenient location near the hearth of the city, everything is in good condition, clean, great breakfast even for people like me that don't like breakfast, awesome room service in a very fare price and fast wifi.  "
50,1. Comfortable clean room 2. Close to airport 3. Shuttle service to airport 4. Gated Secure interior corridor accommodations  5. Excellent breakfast 6. Shops inside gated area 7. English spoken 8. Excellent friendly staff 9. Reasonable rates
50,"Perfect location, just behind the airport, with free airport pickup. It's really close by, but you don't want to go walking with luggage in the city. Friendly service, good beds, nice terrace and safe. Dinner is provided from a nearby restaurant if you need that and breakfast is good, served in the garden. Taxi and tour service is available and reliable."
50,"We had an early flight out of GUA, so we were hoping to find a hotel close to the airport with an early morning shuttle.  Hostal Villa Toscana fit the bill perfectly.  It is a very secure property and I'm not sure I would have found it myself if the shuttle driver wouldn't have known where it was.  The rooms were very clean and the showers were by far the best we had experienced on our entire trip.  We had an excellent WiFi signal in our room and the staff was very helpful with check-in/check-out.    We were given orange juice and a trail mix bar on our way out the door in the morning because we were departing before they served their breakfast.  All in all, I would highly recommend this hostal for folks needing a place close to the airport.  Great all the way around."
40,"Didn't arrive until 9 pm and street was gated with guards - very secure.  Large rooms, very clean, although wi-fi was inconsistent.  AC and TV worked well.  Departed the next morning at 5 am (the earliest time for their free ride to the airport) and arrived at terminal within 5 minutes.  Very convenient for arriving or departing from Guatemala City.  Very comfortable!"
50,"Very nice rooms, wifi, tv, hot water and safe. Just pay 10$ to the next door hotel and you have access to pool, gym & sauna.  Hotel is located in a very nice area, you can walk to different bars & restaurants at night. Hooters & Hard Rock Cafe is very near, just walk a couple blocks."
30,"They charge you separately for Internet, an exorbitant $15/day, which is absurd in this day and age. The rooms are spacious, get cleaned every day, and there's a very large pool in the courtyard. Breakfast is included, although not very good. The eggs are almost 50% cheese and very runny. Occasionally they'll have pancakes. Just be sure not to get there close to 10 on a Saturday or there might not be anything left. Very well located in zone 10, walking distance to a wide range of bars and restaurants. "
40,"Really good hotel for budget trips. Rooms are moderns and had wonderful beds. A really good point is that they have drinkable water for free, so you don't have to buy expensive bottled water. Negative side is that they don't have gym, so you have to rent the one from Westin which is connected by a door. Breakfast was included in the price, but it wasn't too variety."
30,"I stayed at the Biltmore for four nights recently for business. The hotel was recommended to me by colleagues. It felt safe, easy to get to from the airport (the shuttle is very convenient), and convenient to every place I needed to go in Guatemala. The experience, however, can just be classified as average. The room smelled funky when I got there. The desk chair was broken, and never replaced even though I asked. There was no water in my room (which would have cost $2 anyway). Internet is not included, which is weird, but at least fast. The breakfast is suitable."
20,"Rooms are modern and prices decent... but you have to pay for drinking water, staff are friendly but either angry or still in training (called the hotel twice to speak to a colleague and was accidently connected to the managers home phone - who got annoyed at me, not the switchboard) and finally, the Internet is dreadful. The location is fine, but use the back door and walk through the sister hotel Camino Real to go restaurant hopping. It's safer and easier."
40,"Less than two minutes to Guatemala Airport, very dependable shuttle to and from. Located in a secure, gated street.  Nice sized rooms, very clean.  No worries traveling as a solo woman here.They will give you yogurt, fruit, orange juice, and hot water for tea or coffee if you need to leave prior to their breakfast service. "
40,"Close to the airport which is good because if you arrange a shuttle from Antigua, it will drop you at Villa Toscana... well, not quite because it is in a sort of gated neighbourhood, so you need to walk 100m. The staff are great and go out of their way to help. The single room I had was a generous size, the garden is tranquil, the area is quiet and SECURE, and even though I had to check out before breakfast (included in the tariff), they gave me a granola bar and some orange juice at 4 a.m. as a sort of concession."
20,"We stayed here only one night due to its proximity to the airport, as we were arriving in the evening and leaving to Flores the next morning. The first problem was, our connecting flight to GUA was delayed by 1.5 hours and we had no means of letting them know. Of course, when we were outside of the arrivals hall, no one was waiting for us, as it never occurred to them to check the new arrival time instead of going away. I had to call the hotel 3 times to make them send the driver again. First time the owner said, the driver is there waiting for us, but we couldn't find anyone. And then I called again and said, please call the driver and ask where he exactly is. After the third call, from an international phone number of course, the driver came finally. The place was so close to"
50,Read the prior reviews of the hotel and was impressed so I decided on my last night in Guatemala City I would stay there. Wasn't disappointed. I took the suite and wasn't disappointed. From the owner on down to the staff I must say your Bed & Breakfast is wonderful. I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone without any reservations.
40,"Nice, safe place to stay, very close to the airport.  Offers free taxi service to the airport.   Nice grassy enclosed patio in back, a deck on the 2nd floor, great for pizza and beer.   Had a very early flight and the manager got up to serve us breakfast, nothing fancy but there was an effort, he did everything to make us happy.  They also have wine and beer if you desire.  "
30,"Received phone call from front desk while sleeping after 11pm for no reason. Also received knocking on door reminding of check out at 8am when checkout was not till noon. Also had cleaning lady try and enter room when sleeping without knocking asking ""are you leaving soon"" to which I replied we aren't checking out till noon. Toilet was also clogged upon arrival. "
50,"I loved staying there, the staff are very welcoming and find ways to accommodate me.  I was able to watch sports, NBA finals, the final game for the St. Louis Blues. It was great, I will stay there every trip."
40,"Good business hotel with all the facilities you can expect from a 5-star hotel. Ample, comfortable rooms. Excellent staff and very good choice of bara and hotels. Conveniently located close to the airport and the business district."
50,"Great hotel and staff.  The kids had a fun time at the pool.  We watched NBA at the sports bar.   One and only issue was getting parking stamp, staff member was annoyed because we approached on side as the line up for check-in was busy. They should have a better option.  Concierge perhaps should take that little inconvenience from staff. Our Bell gentleman’s service was exceptional!! They made sure we made it to the airport on time as we didn’t have enough space in one car the recommended options. Uber still only has small cars in Guatemala. Plan with your hotel ahead.  Thanks Barcelo will be back. "
40,Spent a few days here. Nice hotel. Clean. Good staff. Walking distance to a lot of options for food and shopping. Felt very safe but just use common sense when out and about. Breakfast buffet is good with plenty of options. Would stay here again. 
50,The immediate residential vicinity is walled for security. There is free airport transfer. Hotel isvery comfortable. Staff was very helpful with local arrangements that I couldn't do myself. Excellent value.
50,"We stayed last night since it was close to the airport. The place was very clean, the staff were extremely friendly, and the bed was so comfortable! You can order in food from their menu. Just a side note, if you order Chinese food it comes in a huge bucket! Easily enough food for two or three. There is a nice courtyard in the backyard where you can read or relax. We all felt very safe while we were here. The prices were very reasonable as well. I'd stay here again for sure!"
50,Our Chemainus BC Rotary team stayed here before returning to Canada after a work project at Lake Atitlan.  The hotel was very clean and comfortable and our hosts even got up before 4 a.m. To give us coffee and a light breakfast before our early morning flight.  We would definitely stay here again.
50,"Our usual experience of hotels by the airport are expensive and mediocre. However, it was a pleasant surprise to find Hostal Villa Toscana. As we booked a little late, only the suite was available, but that was only at $68 per night (March 2014). We thought, oh why not?   The hotel staff was exceedingly helpful. He thought of what we needed before we did. Since it was almost 9pm when we arrived, he made sure we ordered some food before the restaurant closed otherwise we would have dilly-dallied and then realized it was too late (there is no restaurant at the hotel so we had to rely on delivery).   Our suite was beautiful with a side window and also private porch that was rather large. We loved having a porch that looked down to the garden. It also had a view of the volcano."
50,"Lovely room, clean, comfortable, great bed, quality linens, quiet, amazing hosts who went out of their way for us. If you need to stay near the airport, this is the place to be! Walking distance to the airport, the museum, artesans."
40,This is a very good hotel and the staff is very attentive. They have a free airport shuttle which is great. I didn't like the fact that Internet is extra and one whole day it was not working. There is no gym or pool although you can use the one from the hotel next door. I don't think they should charge you to use it though.
50,"Excellent place with quality service. Delicious food and comfortable rooms. We enjoy our stay in the hotel, clean bathroom, variety of choice at breakfast, the hotel have a covered parking and have promotion.              "
40,"Wonderful services and amenities up to US standards but with almost US prices - priciest place I stayed in all of Guatemala.  Breakfast is plentiful with a lot of variety, and delicious.  Convenient location just a few minutes from the airport, and the airport shuttle was reliable and easy to find.              "
50,My television could not  function until the technician was called to fix the batteries of the remote control Well located but did not offer any thing of value to a first- timer at the hotel. The front desk had a sweet lady who was intuitive and acted very fast to check my foreign exchange difficulties
50,"Went to a wedding.  This hotel is excellent and located in a very safe place with lots of restaurants around.  Staff is excellent, they would help you a lot.  The other good thing of this Hotel is it is part of a large hotel chain, the Camino Real.  This hotel conects to the Camino Real in Guatemala where there are lots of restaurants. Camino Real is also in Tikal...  a very nice place to visit and also Camino Real Antigua.  Antigua is great.   I book my tours directly at the Camino Real.   Great tour company."
50,The staff are all very excellent. Any minor issue we had was attended to quickly and resolved. Breakfast buffet is amazing the best I have seen in a any hotel. Room and bed are extremely comfortable. Sushi restaurant is great also. And a plus with the convenient airport shuttle 
40,"It is a good clean hotel, without any problems. It is a little bit dated, but kept in very good order. I have stayed here previously, and it will be my first option any time that I return to Guatemala."
50,"The staff was very friendly and the facility was very clean. For the past couple years I’ve use Barceló Hotel as my number one choice when I travel to Guatemala. The price is very affordable, it has a good location, the facility is always clean, and what I like the most is the friendly staff. I recommend it his hotel to my friends and family. "
50,"I arrived by myself, late at night on a Friday.  It felt very safe from the moment when the shuttle bus pick me up from the airport until the moment of my departure.  I used their computer helpline service with great satisfaction.  "
50,"Great proximity to airport in upscale Zone 10. Hotel restaurants and bar were great. The staff is exceptional! They are polite and professional and my speaking English (and very rusty Spanish) was no problem. They have a convenient airport shuttle, too. "
50,"After a fabulous 2 weeks in Guatemala: I didn't expect much from a place that would cater to the overnite airport traveler.  What a gem!  Great room, great staff and the touch of European taste that the owner brings.  Unfortunately, our very early a.m. flight didn't allow us to try breakfast.  But at these prices, I am going to recommend this to anyone traveling out of Aurora airport! "
40,"If you are using Guatemala City as a hub for visiting Guatemala then the Hostal Villa Toscana is worth considering.  In a secure compound only minutes from the airport the hotel is small, very clean and comfortable.  At the reasonable price of about $50 US double, you have a nice room and a morning breakfast to start your day.  Lots of places to order takeout food from and the Hostal will serve that for you on proper plates, glasses, etc. in their breakfast area or out in the garden area at no extra charge.  The only down side would be for those who are very sensitive to sound.  You are close to the airport and a military base will give you lessons in drumming and mass singing very early in the morning.  Local dogs barking, any time of the day or night."
10,"This place was recommended by a traveler on Lonely Planet as being a reasonably priced ($45 USD for single), safe ""hotel"" near the airport in Guatemala City.  It was in compound, surrounding by wire fencing and with a security guard.  So close to the airport that you heard the planes reeving up to take off ... probably under 6 blocks away.  The free transportation to the airport was in a FILTHY cab that was on its last leg (ie. seat didnt even have springs left in it) and there was no doubt the driver was looking for a tip for this 5min ride.  Barely slept as the walls are paper thin... I could hear every sound down too a person coughing or flushing a toilet (by staff or in other rooms).  The room had mosquitoes zipping around which is not a good feeling in a country with issues"
40,"Could not be better as a base for airport, in a gated community a couple of minutes from international terminal. You could literally walk it (although not advisable with cases at wrong time of day), but you don't need to as they supply free transport. Archaeological museum and zoo are a 15 minute walk away. Room on first night was very basic, room on second night was excellent next to garden. Breakfast in small garden very pleasant. In evening you can order a takeaway through reception.  No problem with flight noise as flights are infrequent. Like rest of Guatemala will accept US dollars and you will get a better exchange rate, a lot better than licensed rip off rate at airport bureaux. If traveling to Flores on one of the smaller airlines note that they go from another terminal"
50,"Great place. Clean, super convenient for visiting zoo, handicrafts mall & archeological museum with Tikal lintels. You can walk to the airport. Safe and very comfortable. Easy taxi to downtown shopping & restaurants. Great, hot showers!"
50,"We easily made a reservation on line and then checked in easily.  The room was extremely comfortable -- walk in roomy shower with good water flow and very clean; the bed and pillows were super comfortable.  We had a great view of the pool which is gigantic and does not border a parking lot as so often happens in U.S. hotels.  Hotel Biltmore is part of a hotel complex so there is dining and night life in the immediate area.  We were unfamiliar with the area and did a lot of walking to discover places to visit -- there was a multi-story mall close by and other places too like the American Embassy, a university museum, etc.  We had a small map from the front desk, but that could have been improved with more of the fun locations marked on the map."
40,"Very comfy clean rooms, excellent staff, great and safe location, close to restaurants and night life. The only thing that make me rate 4 stars is the price of the internet (15 dollars per day) and the lack of fridge in the rooms. The rest, is just perfect.  Highly recommended."
40,"I would like to have internet free in my room, almost all the hotels include it. The bar would be better, nowadays is small and not comfortable. After 3 reservations, you could include one day in La Cabaña gym. The rest of the services are really good.       "
30,So nice premises but personnel needs to be more warm with guests. The parking lot does not have elavator going directly to the hotel. This kind of survey is interesting but it makes no sense that you are required to write at least 200 characters.       
50,"An overall excellent experience. Clean rooms, a good night sleep, and in an excellent location. With everything else you may need at a very short walking distance. It is definitely an excellent option when in Guatemala.        "
40,Excellent service. Outstanding breakfast buffet. Room cleanliness was excellent. Pool had black gum between tiles in grout that must be scrubbed away. Highly recommend this facility. Barcelo knows how to keep a quality Inn.
10,"Wouldn’t recommend or stay here again I am used to friendly staff whenever I stay In any hotel in Guatemala  This one lacks of friendliness  Rooms are really dated, the bar lacks of variety, I supposedly got an upgrade unfortunately it did. Not seem like an upgrade  Room was overlooking a white tent  I think a party was going on because  I could hear the music at night  I couldn’t be more disappointed  "
50,For anyone who wants to come to Guatemala for business or simply to relax and enjoy the view of the city come to hotel Barcelo’ nice clean and their staff is very friendly they will go out their way for what ever you need you will be very pleased 
50,"I spent my honeymoon last year here, I loved the facilities, the gym, pool, store, the food, room service. Wonderful. Also thewalls  were like sound-proof. Downstairs there was a christian event that was so loud as usual but when we go to our room there was nothing to hear, that is really comfortable, after all is a building with 5 floors so makes sense the walls are thick."
50,"Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The room was clean and I really enjoyed all of the bars, restaurants, gym, pool and VIP room.  Thank you for such a pleasant stay to all of the staff starting with reception."
40,"We stayed here for one night before an early flight to Flores.  It was very clean and secure with great service.  Since we arrived mid afternoon, the staff ordered us a pizza to be delivered and served it to us in the very pleasant back garden.  They also quickly supplied us with wine glasses so we could enjoy the bottle we brought with us.  Internet access was good with no interruptions in service.  Because we were leaving very early for our 6:30 flight, they arranged a taxi for us at no charge and provided us with bottles of orange juice and granola bars to take with us.  I'm sure there are nicer hotels in Guatemala City, but for the price, service, security and location literally two minutes from the airport, this place fit the bill."
40,"This well-run little hotel is just a few minutes' walk from the airport, in a small secure complex. The staff were very friendly, the room comfortable and clean, and there's an attractive little walled garden at the back. Breakfast was simple and good.  Inevitably, jets and turboprops can be heard taking off from around 5.30 am. And, when we arrived, music from what sounded like a nightclub a few doors away was audible until some time around midnight. Not a lot the hotel can do about either of these things, other than instal double-glazing, I suppose. Otherwise it was a fairly quiet spot, and we weren't really bothered. I'd go back."
40,"This bed and breakfast is located very close to the airport and was perfect when I arrived from Flores in the evening and departed for the US the next morning. Room was small and simple but clean and comfortable and had its own bathroom. Service was also simple but good, and breakfast was great. There is a nice backyard behind the hotel as well. The hotel is walled in and inside a very secure neighborhood next to the airport with similarly walled in houses. I don't think there would have been much venturing out in the area without a taxi. They were very good about taking me to and from the airport though, and on time. The price was also very reasonable, so overall a great choice for my layover in Guatemala City."
30,"We had read great reviews, so we booked here a week before arriving to Guatemala, and what a fuss it was : they want you to send all credit card details just like that in a mail!  It gave us a quite mistrusting impression for the rest of our stay in better hostals and hotels in Guatemala (which didn´t correspond to reality, fortunately). People were very friendly and gave good service (we asked how to get to one of the museums nearby and thought we needed to get a taxi, but they printed a map so we could go walking), but you need a taxi to get anywhere further than zone 13 or at night, which is quite expensive adding everything up, when staying here longer than absolutely necessary. One further comment : this is an example of a place dedicated to US tourists, as all prices are"
50,"This is a family run place with lots of style. I was surprised to find such a quality place in this part of Guatemala City, with such reasonable prices. Outstanding service, very comfortable beds, a free ride to/from the airport. The rooms are very quiet, despite it being very close to the airport.  If you want to see the tourist attractions in Zone 1, don't stay near there - pay a little more, stay here and take the bus into the city (you may even save money, counting the taxi fares). This place is much safer, easier, and vastly more comfortable."
40,"I stayed in the city for 4 days, and I loved this hotel, the staff was very efficient and friendly, the rooms were comfortable, the hotel was clean and has a very good appearance; however, because the company paid for my room, I can’t tell you if it worth the price compare to the locations/food/service. The hotel it's located in a very good area, Zona 10, which is very close to restaurants, bars, or shopping areas in the city. Wi-Fi is free only in the lobby, anywhere else you'll have to pay $15 per 24 hours service that can be shared between 3 devices at the same price, they've drycleaning service for an extra fee, also they've every 30 minutes a bus schedule to the airport (is very close to it). The rooms are very comfortable, and they keep them clean and comfortable, the room"
40,I stay 1 week in Biltmore Hotel and it was a great hotel. I like that it connects with Westin Camino Real by a door in the lobby and you can acceses all their services. Ask if in your hotel fee it's incluided the internet service.
40,"First time at this Hotel in Guatemala City. Located in the Zona Viva, known for its Restaurants and nightlife. Can say is well located for both -tourism and work stays.  Staff is very efficient and ready to accomodate on your needs. Rooms are very nice furnished, with confortable beds and good working space. Internet worked well during stay.   Breakfast área in main lobby was good, choices were good but sometimes juices refills took a while to get. For lunch or dinner you have the added advantage of using the facilities of Camino Real Hotel - member of the chain - to which you have free Access!  Transportation is offered to and from the airport to the guests. You are close to different options of Restaurants within a 3 or 4 blocks radius.  If you visit Guatemala City, consider"
50,"I have stayed many times over the past several years at the Camino Real.  Recently I was asked by friends what more economical places may be available and when I suggested The Biltmore they asked if I had stayed there myself.  Since I had not I decided to give it a try.   There is a free shuttle service from the airport that services both hotels, the driver had a list of names of people who were to be picked up.  I like the fact that the hotel is too far from the airport.  The lobby is clean, not as impressive as its sister property but functional, there is a place for breakfast (included with the price of your room) and there are coffee, tea and pastries available most of the day.  Since I had taken an early flight my room wasn't ready just yet but the woman at reception"
40,Good location.  Clean and spacious room.  Breakfast is good enough and I really enjoyed room service (both food and attention). Desk staff was helpful but rather cold and sometimes a bit rude (I had the feeling that asking for anything else than the usual was annoying)
50,I stay at The Barcelo often when I visit Guatemala and highly recommend it. The staff are always kind and helpful and the rooms are very comfortable and quiet. The hotel is only 5-7 minutes from the airport which makes it very convenient. 
50,"This is a great hotel in Guatemala City. Although traffic may make it seem like it is far from the airport, it is only a 10-12 minute drive without traffic. Great location and very helpful staff. Multiple restaurants including a sports bar with great food and with a live band (almost too loud), a Japanese restaurant as well as a local restaurant which also served breakfast in the mornings. Shuttle service to airport on the hour is a great plus. Only 5-10 min car ride to the museums at UFM. All in all, a very good experience for a short business trip."
50,"Barcelo’ Hotel and Convention Center was a Great Stay! Very Clean,Excellent Service and they have 3 Restaurants onsite, along with Strikers Sports Bar. They also have a nice Lounge/Bar in the Lobby area. I was there for 1 week and couldn’t be Happier. The only area that needs to be improved is they should have USB Ports installed in the rooms as I left my plug and could charge my phone or iPad unless I brought them to the front desk By the way, there’s a nice Pool and a Very Nice gym equipped with Free Weights, Machines with Weights , Stationary Bikes as well as Treadmills.... Overall, a great experience and I will stay there on my next visit in 5 weeks!!"
50,"The Hotel Barceló is located within a few minutes of the airport with a free airport shuttle.  It is a beautiful hotel with excellent facilities and the price is very reasonable.  The breakfast buffet is ridiculously huge and the service is excellent!  It is a clean, well kept and well managed hotel with very friendly, helpful staff.  I would recommend it to anyone."
50,"I stayed here during a Gate 1 trip, and it was excellent. Spacious room, nice pool and sauna, and awesome buffet breakfast. The servers in the restaurant were super helpful & the lobby staff were really nice. It’s close to everything & it has a convenient shuttle. I would stay here even if I wasn’t in a tour group."
50,"No view to enjoy from this room, but it did not matter. Service was excellent. Delivered everything as promised and on time; which I really appreciated after my travel agency left me stranded at the airport at night. Short walk or drive to the airport from the Hostal.  Clean, comfortable rooms with amiable staff; especially Sergio. Would stay here again definitely!"
40,"Hostal is located on a 7 - 8 minutes walk from La Aurora International Airport of Guatemala-City. You may hear an aircraft passing by during the day, but as you usually spend the day outside in the city you do not care a lot about. As a stay for starting and ending a trip through Guatemala, Hostal Villa Toscana is the perfect place to spend a night.   Rooms are clean and conveniently furnished. Free Wi-Fi ist offered in all parts of the Hostal and works fastly and without any problems. There is also a computer station for general use in case you do not carry any laptop  on you (there is a printer too, in case). The stay includes rich breakfasts (Continental, American as well as Guatemaltecan). Owners (family) and staff are very friendly and helpful. If necessary, they give you"
50,"Our flight was five hours late, yet the hostal had our ride to the hotel waiting even though it was after midnight. This gave us tremendous peace of mind!  Very friendly owners and staff. The owner arranged a safe and reasonable collectivo to Antigua. A great breakfast as well. We would definitely return if a next trip to Guatemala is in our future!"
50,"Eight of us traveled there for a mission trip from our church.  The staff, especially Ericka, was extremely cordial, professional and kind to us.  Rooms were clean, plenty of hot water, and the patio/ courtyard was very relaxing.  Close to the airport, we couldn't hear any of the noises.  A perfect place just to relax .  We had cable tv and wi-fi so we could communicate for free."
50,"The staff at Toscana are delightful, the food is good, showers are hot and the little garden is a nice place to relax. You can walk to the airport but no need as they will pick you up. Airplane and city noise is expected, but inside the hostal it is beautiful and comfortable. I have stayed twice and will do so again. I highly recommend this hotel."
50,Great 5 days at this hotel. People were friendly and attentive; food was excellent and room very good. WiFi at times a little slow. And disappointed there was no chair in the room - beyond the desk chair.
50,"I have been traveling often to Guatemala for business purposes since more than a year and, after try other options, I am sure this is the most convenient; just what you need for business trips... high value at good price."
50,This hotel has upgraded significantly since four years ago when I stayed before.  Our room was beautifully renovated.  We had an air conditioner that was quiet and very quick to get the room to temperature.  The breakfast is exceptional.  The pastries are of the highest quality.  The hotel runs a free airport shuttle that operates most hours of the day.  I took  the shuttle at 4am.  The pool and hot tub had a small extra charge but was impeccably maintained and very beautiful. There are also spa services available.Great hotel.
40,"I have stayed there four times in the last two years with Habitat for humanity, All four times the rooms were very clean and luxurious. Just around the corner from the Weston and Hard Rock Cafe, good food available."
40,"Stayed here only for one night - arrived late - left early, but had a good sleep in a huge bed with fresh bedlinen. Rooms was big - bathroom also big. Waterpressure in shower could have been better, now it took quite some time to get rid of soapfoam. But breakfast - marvellous! Plenty of choices and even the coffee was almost strong.  Good service from staff - and decent WiFi."
40,"Stayed here for one night each on two separate occasions!  Stayed on the 7th floor and on the 9th floor.  The rooms were clean and well kept!  All the rooms have a veranda where you can hang out/have breakfast.  The check-in was smooth!  Nice pool, and good for business/conferences as it’s a sizable property.  Good breakfast buffet (nice spread and variety).  There are three restaurants on site (including a Japanese sushi place).  Didn’t try them as we didn’t want to spend a whole lot of money on food.  There’s a McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and KFC just around the corner, where you can have a decent quick inexpensive meal without any frills!  There’s a small souvenir shop in the hotel as well in case you want to have a last-min gift before heading back home!"
50,Thank you for a great experience. The staff was friendly  and helpful. The bath towels where large and not hard like others. Since I arrived on late flight I should have checked with your hotel about transportation. There where other hotels there.  suggestions: 1- partner up another hotel to have more time available. 2- Have any other news(in English) than CNN. Thank you again for your time
50,"Beautiful hotel!!!  Close to the airport, great buffet breakfasts, great lap pool, service excellent.  Very pleased with our whole stay. Second time staying here when visiting Guatemala City and it won’t be the last!!! "
20,"The adjoining room was so loud I could hear the couple aurguing, staff heard it and ciuld nit resolve it...pool was amazing, eucalyptus sauna was awesome, shops convenient...but bed bugs, at this price point, even saved tge bug and showed the manager...not a whiff of concern...never again."
50,"I’m a person who travel a lot for business so perfectly i can identify a bad,good and excellent service, this time i had to experience the last. So don’t hesitate to travel to Ciudad de Guatemala ,and make sure to stay at Barcelo Guatemala.  :-)"
30,"Sunday buffet breakfast finishes at 11am, we arrived at 10am and there was not food  , I asked the waiter and I didnt received the best service, he checks the time and says ""I will bring a little is too late"" and only took eggs and some bread.The rooms are comfortable with clean bathrooms. Although the window is closed the street noise is heard. "
40,"This is an unusual property that is actually physically connected to another hotel- the Westin.  The Biltmore is definitely the lower quality of the two brands. However, if you stay at the Biltmore, you can use any of the restaurants, bars, etc on the Westin side. This includes a nice outdoor swimming pool, two lighted tennis court, and a really well appointed health club facility.  A highlight of our visit at this hotel was the Sunday brunch, which took place (buffet style) in the main dining room of the Westin. It was a Cuban festival themed brunch, and was outstanding. The waitstaff was superb, and made us feel very special with their warmth and attentiveness.  The lowlight of our one night at this hotel was the crappy air conditioning system in our room. It was either too"
40,Stayed here one night before returning home from a long vacation.  The beds were to DIE for!  So comfy and big and fluffy.  The best sleep!  The staff was friendly and the room was clean.  Close to the airport.  We walked around the hotel area too and felt safe.  Would return again.
40,"A safe place in a good location, the Biltmore is a step up from budget and worth the price.  Located in Zone 10 with good shopping and nice restaurants, this hotel is connected to the Westin Camino Real and for an added cost you can have access to the pool and gym."
40,"I stayed at the Hotel Biltmore not by choice but by specification.  My last night in Guatemala, I told my travel agent to get a hotel near the airport (rather than leaving from Antigua), so they got me the hotel.  It meets my specification; near the airport and in the safe area (that was what everyone at the hotel and restaurant told me).  The hotel is nice and clean with friendly staff.  The airport shuttle leaves every half and hour starting at 4 am (very prompt) and also with a a couple minute pick up passengers at the West In hotel next door. I got a nice room on the 4th floor with the view of the volcano and tennis court which was fine except the noise from families on the same floor.  Problems, rooms are not sound proof.  I could hear the conversations and activities from"
50,"we have been at this great hotel near the air port. it was just perfect ! so clean and comfortable + great breakfast - we couldn't have better than that. the beds were so big and comfortable , which we slept well. one KM from there there are the zoo , the art market and the kids & museums."
40,"After a long day;s travel, I was met at the airport and driven the 3 minute ride to Villa Tosacana.  The staff was very friendly and helped me settle in and organized my onward travel.  The room was small but clean and nice.  The shower had a strong flow and hot water as advertised.  The WiFi single was excellent as well.  i had a nice breakfast with good coffee and then set out.  All in all, it was a very pleasant experience."
50,"Great place to stay - your accommodation includes breakfast. We stayed for one night as we were looking for a place close to the airport (which is literally 5 mins away). The cost also includes transportation to the airport.  We arrived from Panajachel in torrential rain but were greeted by a wonderful host, who even was able to order food for us.  Recommend if you need a place to stay close to the airport."
50,"I had intended on writing a review after we stayed here in February of 2012. This is a bit late, but I must comment. We were on our way home from a whirlwind tour of Guatemala and decided to stay at Villa Toscana because of the close proximity to the airport. When we arrived we were greeted by an English speaking person who was very friendly and got us settled in with no problem. Our rooms were spotless, the beds comfortable and we had a nice view of the garden.  They had a menu and we decided to order something in. Again the staff were helpful, our meal of chicken arrived and we sat in their lovely garden area to eat it.  We had use of internet, although it was better in one room than the other. Our sleep was great even though we needed to get up in the wee hours of the morning"
40,"Summary: A nice hostel/hotel, we only stayed for a night before traveling through Guatemala. Good: - Massive comfortable bed, clean bathroom, cable TV, nice terrace with view of well maintained garden  - Secure location within gated community  - Decent breakfast included in the price  Bad  - Check in was a little lengthy  - Quite expensive"
40,"We stayed for a week at the Barcelo in April, my partner and I and our young child. First of all, the customer service is top notch. Every person was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the hotel and restaurants. The breakfast is really great with lots of vegetarian options. I would definitely recommend getting the room with breakfast included. The pool area is very nice but is very busy all day. The rooms and common areas were very clean and the amenity kits were comprehensive. The entire hotel is a bit dated and could use and overhaul. Also the location isn’t as nice/convenient as the Hyatt/Westin/Intercontinental hotels. It’s on the wrong side of the main boulevard. Still, it’s a great value and you can uber anywhere."
40,"The hotel was very well located and close to airport , good service and nice breakfast . The gym needs upgrade no bench and dumbbells between 5-20 lbs and carpet in corridor needs change . The shuttle service is free and has multiple restaurants on the site . "
50,"Traveled to Guatemala fir a family emergency. The Barceló had the best rates for the dates I was there. The Hotel staff was professional, courteous, & friendly. I felt safe during my stay.  The bed mattress was amazing! Slept like a baby. The shower was excellent as well. The room, very clean. "
40,I used the laundry service. It was difficult to write in the type of clothes and I had to ask the person in charge for help. It took time to receive because there was no information about payment. I thought that information should be added to the hotel use guide placed in the room.
50,"Everything was really good, reception, room service, clean no doubly about I will comeback to.  guatemala BARCELÒ shuttle from and to the airport really good, is not to much I can say about you'll because everything was the way it suppose to be"
30,"First time to Guatemala and stayed at a few different hotels, the Biltmore was about a 4 star rating; access to the pool via the Westin for a fee was a bonus, includes breakfast at the hotel which is always nice as well, quiet and clean"
40,"Using hotel for a work assignment a standard 4 star chain. Everything worked fine breakfast excellent, but don,t get there after 730' not much left! It's ok, if you are not looking for any culture, but I didn't,t pick it."
50,"We stayed here four years ago and were less than impressed.   Fast forward, and we were in GC and stayed one night.  The hotel has been totally updated.  Rooms and showers are great and there is now a real breakfast bar."
40,"I  visited this hotel in tragic circumstances, following the unexpected death of my daughter in Guatemala. I flew into the country and needed a small, central, discreet place where I could sort out funeral arrangements etc. This hotel was just what was needed. It was clean, quiet, well appointed, very reasonable, and the staff were excellent - very helpful, yet not too intrusive. They sorted out any requests swiftly and enthusiastically. The hotel made a terrible personal tragedy  a tolerable experience thanks to the excellent staff.."
40,"We arrived tired by 6-8 hour flight delay/cancellation.  The hotel processed us quickly, we had menu limited meals at the adjacent/connected Starwood Westin (a mega hotel).  The Biltmore is an economical 'business class' hotel that benefits from its cooperative ownership with the Westin and Raddison chains.  It is clean, well managed, well kept (superior bathrooms), in the city's Zone 10 commerce center.  The breakfast buffet off the Biltmore lobby was fresh and abundant.  Staff were helpful.  No complaints - the hotel seems to understand its niche and works hard to keep up to international business travel standards."
50,"I was just passing through and had a one night stay. I was given a good clean ensuite nicely decorated room with internet.  The service from the free pickup at the airport to the next day breakfast was very friendly, nice and efficient.  All for U$ 38.00.  The best bargain I've ever had and I travel a lot."
40,"Simple, small, guesthouse type hotel very 5 minutes from airport in gated community. Staff, particularly Sergio, is very friendly and accommodating. Very quiet, safe to walk around neighborhood during the day and go to the tienda outside the gated community. I really enjoyed sitting in the garden in the backyard and reading and checking my email (WIFI available). Price seems reasonable as well."
30,"Having a 6 AM flight to Mexico City, I decided to stay at Villa Toscana based on the reviews.  Perhaps the ""hostal"" should have given me a hint, but I was underwhelmed by the single room I was given.  If you've ever had a full-body MRI, you'll know the feeling.  Unless you're really not bothered by claustrophobic conditions, you're better off taking a larger room, which was fine for the short amount of time I was going to spend there.  The place has more of a rooming house atmoshere than that of a hotel.  It was pretty empty that night, but I can only imagine the noise of the comings and goings when it was full.  In fairness, it was clean, secure, quiet and definitely convenient to the airport, though $6 for a 2 minute taxi ride seemed a bit steep. And if you're expecting to"
50,"I have been bringing mission teams to Guatemala every 6 months for the past 2 years.  We stay at Hostal Villa Toscana every time because the staff is so friendly and amazing to work with across county lines.  We have always felt welcome with open arms and treat just like an extension of the family each time. The accomidations are always very appealing (the courtyard area is always a favorite) and breakfast is always delicious! Hostal Villa Toscana is also convienent to the airport, though very little airport noise so you sleep well.  I would definitely recommend it to others visiting Guatemala City and know I will continue to stay there each time I/our team visits."
40,"This is a nice little hotel in within a guarded, gated community.  Perfect for a last night in the city before an early morning flight.  It was surprisingly quiet considering is was only about 2 minutes from the airport.  It appears it was converted to a bed & breakfast type of hotel from a home.  The rooms have private baths with hot showers but for one of our rooms, the private bath was located across the hall.  It wasn't a problem though.  We left too early to enjoy the breakfast that would have been included, however, the hotel owner provided a take along snack for us and helped us out the door at 4:30am.   That was a very nice touch.  The only suggestion I have for the hotel, is to provide pitchers of drinking water for the guests, as all of our other accommodations in"
50,"It is a very nice place to stay which is located in the famous ZONA 10 around famous hotels, restaurants, malls, etc. As a plus for a little amount of $ you have the benefit of using services of the Westin Camino Real Hotel such as swimming pool, spa, gym, among others."
40,"The location of the hotel is good. Good restaurants and some shopping close by. Rooms are comfortable, Breakfast is OK, yet there are too many people and too little seats, and they need more staff on the breakfast service. they had bread, cheese, cereal, ham... the usual. It was clean, and service was excellent. Overall a good place to stay in Guatemala City."
20,"The only positive thing I can say is that the room was very clean. While I appreciate that, I feel like I should get a little more for my money. There was constant construction going on on the roof of the hotel and the roof of the much nicer hotel connected to the Biltmore. The pounding would start at 8am, and sometimes go as late as 10:30pm. When exactly should I sleep? The wall were so thin I could hear everything on either side of me and out in the hallways. The vent in the bathroom connected to the vent in the room next door. So I was able to communicate to my co-workers while we both in the shower. A bit weird, and uncomfortable. There was a dead cockroach in the lobby one day, and when I pointed it out (twice) to the concierge, he just nodded his head. Apparently he didn't"
20,"Stayed here as the Westin was fully booked. Airco was terribly noisy. I couldn't sleep properly, checked my decibell meter, it showed 70 db of noise. It was either that or sleeping in a sauna.   There was coffee machine but there were neither cups nor coffee. How am I supposed to drink the coffee?"
40,"This is a $90 room, so once you understand the economy my review makes more sense. Two of us arrived on Sunday night to stay the week on business. I was in room 2301 and he was on the second floor. Each of us commented the next morning at breakfast: Wow, what a great hotel! Our host told us this hotel was recently remodeled. My room had a new mattress, pillows, sheets, towels, etc. The quality of the mattress was apparent: it was extremely supportive and comfortable. The air conditioning worked great. There were zero issues with the room. The AC worked perfect, the bed was comfortable, the flat screen TV had US channels, the bathroom was great. All new fixtures in the bathroom and all worked very well. The room was clean, honestly I couldn't find anything wrong with the room.  "
20,When we checked in the person at the front desk was rude and act like it would hurt him to answer any question.  We also used the laundry service and when they came to the room to pick up clothing very rude.  Just a very bad experience!!! Would never stay there again 
50,"We stayed here one night in between flight from Madrid and a flight next day to Flores, Guatemala.   This is  a beautiful hotel and belongs to a well regarded chain.  We had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent.  The room was large and well furnished."
50,Everything was lovely. The bathroom amenities covered all bases. I lacked for nothing. My balconies were spacious and beautiful.  The hotel buffet was huge with many delicious options.  I had wished that the Wi-Fi had been secure.                                                                              
50,"The hotel is located near the airport and very accessible since it is located int he center. The hotel is very clean, considered resort with spa, jacuzzi, nice heated swimming pool open up to 11:00PM daily. The buffet breakfast is excellent with lots of choices and cook to order. Staff is bi-lingual and very helpful. This is my 3rd time staying at this hotel and I highly recommend it."
50,"Barcelo is centrally located and easily accesible from the airport.  This was my third stay and my kids love it.  The staff is always attentive and helpful.  The food from the buffet is, in my opinion, delicious and varied.  The live music during my stay this time around was stupendous.  G.  Jauregui"
50,I have been taking groups of 8-20 people to Guatemala for medical missions for the last 6 years.  We accidentally found the Hostal Villa Toscana in the early years of their business and fell in love with the place.  It has been wonderful to see how it has grown and how they have added more and more rooms and their beautiful courtyard has been landscaped over the years.  Everyone room has a private bath unlike most hostals and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  The Hostal has always been immaculate.  The breakfast is delicious!  I cannot recommend this place high enough!!
40,"We stayed three short nights at this hotel to catch our flights and buses to Tikal, Copan and back home.  The first night we stayed at room 6, which faces the airport and was extremely noisy, also the shower head was not working properly, so for our next stay we requested a different room.  The hotel answered immediately confirming a different room, facing the garden, which in fact was much more quiet.  The staff, Azucena, was efficient and accommodating to our requests about breakfast and so.  In all, a good place if you have to take an early morning flight from Guatemala City.  The only negative point was the fact that they charge for luggage storage, a service that from my point of view should be provided for free."
50,"We chose this hotel based on its fairly cheap prices and proximity to the airport. It's literally two minutes away. It's located in a fenced-in neighborhood with security, so it felt quite safe, and it's also within walking distance of the Archeology and Modern Art museums, the zoo, and a handicrafts market. The rooms were comfortable (though you can hear the planes all the time) and the staff was very helpful. When, by mistake, the night attendant neglected to call our shuttle, he immediately arranged for another shuttle to pick us up within 5 minutes, for free (airport transfers are included in the room price). He also provided us with a granola bar and juice to go, since breakfast is likewise included, but we were leaving too early to use the service. Overall we had a very"
40,We have stayed here twice. Very affordable. Great staff. Friendly and helpful. The perfect place to stay if you need to be near the airport. Rooms probably above for the area but average compared to U.S.
50,"We were pleasantly surprised with Villa Toscana! The staff was very helpful, friendly and made you feel like you were a part of the family. I can't wait to go back again. Azussana, I hope I said her name correctly was especially helpful and really made our stay amazing. When I arrived, I arrived with a bad sprain in my wrist from taking my luggage down from the overhead compartment, asked her where I could find a pharmacy to pick up a brace for my wrist and she called the Medics for me which is a free service they offer. They arrived within a half hour, took a look at my wrist and had me bandaged up. I really appreciated the service as it was my 1st day in Guatemala.  We stayed again before our flight home 2 weeks later and again enjoyed the hotel and staff. Thanks for caring"
50,"I spent one night at Barceló Guatemala City, and would definitely recommend it for a business trip.They offer full breakfast starting at 6:00 am, but continental breakfast is already available at 5:00 am, which is really great when you have to leave earlier than normal! Besides that, you find everything you need in one place... even a beauty salon! Staff is kind and the rooms are very nice. The cost is very reasonable, for everything they offer!"
50,"This hotel looked nice on the website pics...but it was actually nicer than it looked.  Get a room with city view.  Some furniture in rooms a bit outdated, but very comfortable and great city view. The breakfast buffet was marvelous with plenty of choices and fresh and tasty food. I order the grilled meats plate (Guatemalan style) and it was delightful.  The food at the sports bar is sub-par. Great location to explore the city on foot during daylight (you're in a business district so I felt very safe).  Very nice pool and pool area (although I did not use). Best part was the staff...incredible friendly, polite, and very service oriented."
50,Ideal hotel to stay if you need to spend a night close to the airport. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool area was great to spend some time after checking in. Buffet restaurant was OK. Highly recommended.
50,Good stay and good value near airport. Really nice pool area. Really slow check in.  Left too early to benefit from breakfast but it looked good.   Shuttle was only on the hour. Half hourly would be be much better for customer service. 
50,"An amazing stay: staff outstanding, taxi service fantastic, restaurants were scrumptious and shuttle to and from airport was amazing. We will see you again in November. Only place we will stay in the city."
20,"This place is clean and if you are on a budget or better hotels are booked, it will do. My room was very clean, but a mustiness in the air made me sneeze; however, it could be that I'm alergic to 1970-era window air conditioner units that wake you up several times a night. There was no hot water one out of three days and the milk at the breakfast coffee was curdled one out of three mornings. It won't cost much more to stay at a better place; however, the Biltmore is not the worst place I've ever had to stay on business."
40,We stayed here one night with an early am flight out. The hotel was much nicer that many 200 dollar a night hotels I have stayed in. I was very impressed. Free airport shuttle was convenient. Would recommend.
30,"We had one  unscheduled night in this hotel,due to complications with our travel arrangements.The large  room was fine, with a decent shower room, the bed was comfortable. The staff were helpful,the wifi is only free in the lobby.There is a connecting door through to the Westin hotel next door,you can have a meal or a drink there.The breakfast at the Biltmore was very average. It was reasonable enough  for a one night stay."
40,"Good location in Zona 10; felt quite safe and close to good food options. Very good reception staff who were very helpful. Rooms are comfortable, spacious, well equipped and clean. Comfortable beds but sound proofing to the street noise could be better. Breakfast was good in a space just off the lobby. No problems or issues to report but we were only there briefly. "
40,"I stayed at the Biltmore in Nov 2013.    Rooms were clean and comfortable.  TV had a lot of channels to watch.  The shower door dumped a lot of water on the floor when I opened it (two different rooms), so be sure to put down the floor mat before getting in.   This hotel is a $10 cab ride to/from the airport.   The neighborhood is safe (in my opinion, and I was out walking after dark).  There's a Hooter's about 150 yards away- you will pass it on your way to the hotel.  The Obelisk shopping mall is large and located adjacent to Hooters.  While walking around the hotel neighborhood (same side of the big street, behind the hotel), I spotted a Fridays, Applebees, and McDonalds.  There are several little tiendas for pop, beer, chips, etc.  Front desk staff spoke English and were"
50,"We have been staying at Villa Toscana for many years. They just get better and better. Very friendly, VERY clean, very tastefully decorated and good food. The price of the airport shuttle is included as well. And, we can always count on a reasonable price!"
40,"Nice, pleasant surprise. They had a driver waiting for us at the bus terminal. For $75Q we had a taxi ride from the Litegua terminal to the B&B. We had a very nice dinner in their garden. You can order from a menu of Chinese or Mexican and it is comes from a restaurant to your table in about 15 minutes. Didn't get up in time for the included breakfast but loved the place. They speak English and were very helpful."
50,"We flew in on an evening flight from Flores and needed a convenient, comfortable, reasonably priced place to spend the night before catching our flight to Miami.  We could not have been more satisfied with Villa Toscana.  Convenient:  It is literally no more than a 15 minute walk to the Aurora Airport terminal.  Comfortable: the room was very clean, spacious and the bed was the most comfortable we experienced in a month of travel in Guatemala; the interior garden is lush and meticulously manicured, and the breakfast area opening onto it is a delightful place to enjoy the delicious breakfast that is served.  But what makes this little gem of a hotel especially comfortable and convenient is the exceptional staff; every member of the staff with whom we had any contact--housekeeper,"
50,"I was meeting my daughter, who had a late arrival and wanted a safe, comfortable place for us for the night, that was close to the airport. This hotel was perfect! It was clean, nicely furnished and comfortable, quiet, with excellent service. I would definitely stay here again."
40,"Villa Toscana is good place to stay. The location is close to the airport and excellent for early morning flights, although a little away from the rest of Guatemala City. The room was clean and the staff were very helpful. I'd recommend this place to family and friends."
30,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week.  On the positive:  Rooms are clean, large had hot water - though not enough to take a real bath in the nice tub.  Great breakfast and very helpful, friendly English speaking staff both day and evening.  Across the street from the airport and free shuttle there made it very convenient.  On the negative:  A military training camp one block away.  The drums and loud chants of the soldiers were disturbing.  So were the airplanes taking off, landing and the dog nearby barking. The area is safe because each block is strongly gated and access is through a gate with guards which, while you might be safe,  felt like a total prison.  Didn't leave the room past 5 PM but Guatemala City is boring so there was nowhere I wanted to go anyway. I had a friend"
30,"The main reason we stayed here was because of the proximity to the airport.  We only stayed one night and flew out early the next morning.  The amenities weren't too bad, but dated.  Had an old school TV and the bathroom could use some updating.  It was also kind of hard to find the place since it's in a gated area and has a small sign.  Fortunately we found it without too much guessing.    One thing that bothered me was when we checked in, the woman couldn't process the credit card.  She ended up calling a bank and then making an imprint of the card using pencil lead.  It took about five times longer than it should have and she failed to give me the (poor) card back.  I had to ask for it.  We had to leave before breakfast was served, so I can't comment on it.  As a consolation,"
50,"We arrived on a 10:30 pm flight into Guatemala city and it was a treat to settle into Villa Toscana - so close to the airport. They gave us a discount on an upgrade room because the one we asked for wasn't available. Very quiet and comfortable. Enjoyed the tipico breakfast with many cups of organic coffee on the patio the next morning before going off to catch a bus to RIo Dulce. Good wifi, TV reception, helpful staff."
30,"We stayed here for 1 night on our way out of Guatemala City.  Pluses:  1) a 3-minute ride to the airport (unless you're flying domestically) 2) Clean & quiet  Minuses: 1) their website says ""free airport pickup."" I scheduled it, it was confirmed, only to have the owner email me to say my airport transfer was NOT free, because I was flying an airline which was ""too far away"" (it was still arriving at the international airport). She offered to get a taxi for $7.  I noted that her website said all airport pickups were free (one of the reason we booked), AND taxis were $6. She was nice enough to offer us a free pickup after I pointed that out.  2) Most people staying there are on their way to the airport, yet breakfast doesn't serve until 7am...so those of us with an earlier flight"
50,"My husband and I have stayed here many times flying in and out and out of G. City, and it rates far and above any other place we have stayed (when Villa Toscana was booked up).  The family owners/operators are awesome---- very accommodating for all of our needs.  The entire place is super clean, the breakfasts are awesome, and they stock cerveza frio in the fridge!  The hotel is a few minutes from the airport, and they drop us off for free!  It is very safe, enclosed totally within a wall."
50,"Very near Aurora airport and in a safe zone within Guatemala city, this is a great hotel to stay in. The facilities are good and the staff is nice overall. We stayed in “Semana Santa” and the price was very fair."
30,"the location in the Zona Viva is useful for meetings and to get to/from the airport. It's also much less expensive than the hotels in the surrounding area. It's connected to the Westin - where you can use the gym for $10 extra. The continental breakfast is good. Access to wifi is extra ($15/day) which borders on outrageous. I had no end of trouble with the phone (the handset didn't work, they didn't connect the phone so the message said I had checked out - not a good message for colleagues to hear, etc) but the staff was polite and attentive to correct the issues. The shower is amazing...."
50,"If you are looking for a place to stay that's near the airport but also with easy access to the rest of the city, Antigua and beyond, you're going to want to seriously look at Hotel Barceló.  Everything you would want - from a solo traveler to a family of 7 with a serious pile of luggage - can be facilitated at this hotel.  Smooth pick-up at the curb right outside of the Exit doors (turn to your left and walk about 200 feet and see the new Barceló Van - and probably Carlos, the driver).  Friendly Front Desk, where you'll probably be well-served by my new friend, Juan José.  Nice guy.  Excellent room with wonderful beds, thick walls, hot shower, well-supplied and well-lit bathroom, ample space, thick bathrobe, well-equipped rooms, good wi-fi, and good selection of TV channels "
50,"I was unsure staying at this location as I had never heard of them.  I originally was going to stay a 'more American' hotel (marriott, hilton, etc.).  I am so glad I chose this hotel. I liked it so much after leaving Gua City for a few days, when I returned I rebooked at this same hotel.   The property is amazing, staff is amazing, rooms are wonderful, pool/bars/restaurant/food well beyond what I was expecting.  I also chose to stay in an Executive Level room, which was far beyond what I had expected.  I was so please with what they offered.  I had friends who stayed in a room with a balcony who also were very please!    I would highly recommand this hotel.  I have already began to plan for a return trip. "
50,"This was my first visit to Guatemala, and after a very long day of traveling, I was thrilled to arrive at this beautiful hotel that was located somewhat near the airport.  The room was clean, beds were more comfortable than what I had expected, and the bathroom was nice.  We loved the breakfast the next morning!  It has a great assortment of foods, especially fruits, the dining area was pleasant, and the service was great!"
40,"A clean hotel. Nice enough restaurants that you don't feel that you must leave the grounds. It was a great place to land for the night, and head to the airport the next day. The enclosed yard and staff at the door did provide some comfort given the reputation of the downtown part of the City. "
30,"The Hotel Biltmore is conveniently located in Zone 10 and adjacent to Zona Viva where there are many good choices for dining and shopping.  The lobby is clean and welcoming, and the rooms are nicely appointed and modern.  On the positive side, the beds/pillows are comfortable, and the housekeeping is thorough and friendly.  Areas for improvement include customer service and maintenance.  The A/C in my room was not working properly and after my first report, there was no action taken, and I believe even that the front desk was dismissive of my report as no obvious notation was taken at that time.  After my 2nd report, it was clear something had been done to the A/C unit, but it still didn't work, and the 3rd time, no further action was evident.  This was clearly a poor response. "
50,"I like the hotel because has the best rooms the location where is at  is very close to all the near places, so that we can go, cut be for work or fun, has the nice breakfast with a nice area to talk, shar, with all the ones that come to visit us. Another thing that I like is that has  a new tv,s and furniture with the bestconfort bed, where we can have he best time to rest. Because we come from different busy  agenda's so we. Choose his hotel to rest and spend some time to relax and enjoy the view of the city"
40,"The hotel was only about US$80.00 compared to US$150.00 at the Camino Real (hotel to which The Biltmore is attached) They share common grounds which you can use. Good value in good area in Guatemala, Zona 10 or ""Live"" Zone. However, next time will try and stay at La Inmaculada, more my style of hotel; small boutique hotel/ non-chain. A great unforgetable restaurant in area is Donde Mikel.....highly recommended."
40,"After traveling around Guatemala, we stopped in here before our flight back to the US.  It had all the modern conveniences of the good hotel, nice lobby, comfortable room and friendly staff.  We had a good firm queen bed and clean modern bathroom. Cable TV seemed like it had a 100 channels.  There are several good restaurants within walking distance.  There was a convenient, free shuttle service to/from the nearby airport.  Good buffet breakfast in the morning although we did get sick the next day.  Can't be certain it was from here.  We would go back."
30,"The rooms are nice and clean the bed is great. The issues begin with the TV service,  two out of four nights the Cable TV didn't work, the breakfast was very poor of hot food, there was fruits and cereals, but one day they have hard pancakes and the next day some type of french toasts not very yummy. also the rooms was a little noisy."
40,This was an overnight stop from the airport on our way to Lake Atitlan. It had good breaskfast and nice clean comfortable rooms. The staff was helpful - put an extra bed with no issues. The location was safe - we landed here late night and there were no issues getting here. Good for families.
40,"It's close to the airport, reasonably priced, good, clean rooms, great location, excellent breakfast.  It is annexed to the Westin; for a fee you can use their pool and facilities which is a plus.  You also can use their restaurants and bars.  Very good value, helpful, gracious staff."
50,"Came into Guat City late Saturday evening after traveling Antigua to Panajachel that week. Was feeling quite bitten by the stomach bug, and looking at the rooms in one of the local budget hotels left me very unsatisfied. Called a friend, Ryan, who runs a tour business in Guat, and he got me into the Biltmore for only 17USD/nite more than the budget hotel. And when I saw the room at the Biltmore, with a... YES, a KING SIZE bed, I was SOOOO grateful! The bed was absolutely MARVELOUS!, and the service at the hotel (except for breakfast) was top notch. The room included a fridge, plenty of HOT water, and was quiet so sleeping was a blessing. (Their included breakfast is a continental breakfast. The pancakes were cold, the waffles ran out and took nearly 30 minutes to get more.) All"
40,"Value for the money cannot be beat. Included Breakfast is fresh and good. The location is one of the best in Guatemala Ciy. Like most places in Guatemala, the service is very personable and gracious.  Rooms have been remodeled since my last stay, and they are much nicer than before. The remodeled bathrooms look like something that you would expect in a fancy Manhattan apartment, but there are a few problems. First the hot water knob is on the right and you have to turn it down for hot water. Once I figured this out, the water was hot and the pressure was good. However, there was a puddling of water on the floor of the shower, not quite ankle deep.  The toilet was mounted too far behind the counter, which made it impossible to keep the lid up. This is a real problem for male"
50,"Wonderful experience! We stayed at this hotel because our flight had been cancelled and it felt like a little getaway. The staff was so friendly, the buffet food was delicious, and the overall vibe of the hotel was great. Would definitely stay here again! "
50,"We were in Guatemala on a mission trip. We had been in villages doing our work and loving it. After coming back into the city before flying home we spent 1 night here. It was wonderful!!! We had really comfortable beds, plenty of hot water, and a great meal in the sports bar. It was a treat after lumpy beds, little to no hot water, paper thin towels, and sustainable food."
40,"This hotel is in the heart of the city and in a great location, the hotel felt safe and secure and I really enjoyed the pool area. As for the carpets in the guest room halls and the rooms, they felt very outdated. The perfume/room spray that was being used in the hallways to perhaps mask a scent was very strong and overwhelming, we noticed this on multiple floors of the hotel.  It was strong enough to give two of us headaches. It is time for new carpet throughout. Minus that the beds were comfortable and clean, We did not dine in the restaurants, although we did have drinks by the pool, two of our guests who ordered and shared a non-alcoholic juice drink became very ill within 1 hour of drinking the beverage, it was the only shared food item we had and we can only guess that"
50,First time in Guatemala for business and stayed at the Barcelo. The rooms are stylish and comfortable and clean. Breakfast selection was good and tasty. The staff were kind when I fell ill and let me stay in my room till I had to fly which I so appreciated! 10 minutes to the airport but quiet. I'd definitely recommend it. 
50,"My daughter and I had rooms in the Barcelo for ten nights from 21 to 30 March 2019. The rooms were spotlessly clean and housekeeping was prompt and thorough each day. The restaurants -- buffet, Japanese, and sports bar -- were better than many stand-alone eateries of their kind."
50,"Recently I visited Guatemala City. Just by chance I found this wonderful ""bed and breakfast"" and I had a really good time!!! I spent two nigths in this ""hostal"". The price includes room. The room includes a decent tv with cable (main tv shows), internet for free, and two kinds of breakfasts. One called ""Typical Breakfast"" (which I recommend) is a local breakfast and the other is called ""American"" which is a typical breakfast from USA. Both are served either in the dining room or outside next to the garden. They don't serve food at noon or at night. Instead you can ask ""Michael"" to order meals from the around restaurants. The restaurants and small coffe shops deliver.  The food goes from fast food to fine food and the prices are affordable. ""Michael"" will serve the food in the"
40,"An ideal place to stay for a flight out of Guatemala City. The staff were beyond helpful, accomodating, and kind. We had an absolutely incredible stay, the room and the bathroom were tidy and well decorated.  They have a wonderful outdoor area and will even arrange delivery for you if you like. After several weeks in a variety of hostels and lodgings, I can comfortably rank the Terrace Hostel as one of my favorites. Next time we have a flight out of GUA we will definitely choose here again."
50,"I stayed here for 4 nights in August 2011. Really close to the airport and they will pick you up and drop you off with no hassle, even for late / early flights. I only booked a single, but was given a lovely double as they were pretty quiet. Tasty breakfast included and the owners couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Very safe, quiet residential neighbourhood.  There are no bars / restaurants in the area, but there is an extensive take-out menu for delivery, and taxis are cheap in and out of town. I even walked in and out a few times and found it perfectly safe.  Would definitely recommend and would stay here again without question!"
30,"Chose this hotel on the basis of the reviews on here but was disappointed. A few small points which added up to an overall negative experience. When I arrived my room wasn't ready and so I went out into the city for an hour and a half and when I returned my room still wasn't ready so had to sit about waiting! Paid in cash and the receptionist said she had no change and could she give me it later... She never gave me it and I felt too awkward to keep reminded her. Ordered a club sandwich and specifically requested no egg, as I have an allergy, but sandwich came with lots of egg. The wifi didn't work. No hot water in my shower.The hotel uses their own taxi drivers which at first I thought was great until one picked me up to take me to the bus terminal for 6am and didn't know where"
40,"Hostal Villa Toscana is a skip from La Aurora airport. The hostal will make sure you are picked up from and/or dropped off for your flight.  If you're planning on spending time in Guatemala City, you'll have to take taxis from this place. There are no restaurants in the area. You can order food in for dinner from a few eateries.  For touring Guatemala City, the location may not be the best.  But, if you are looking for a safe haven for traveling in & out of Guatemala, this could be your place. For this purpose, it is the perfect solution! Reasonable price. Good breakfast included. The staff is very helpful and nice. Only drawback is it can be a bit noisy at night. The walls are thin & you'll hear the other guests as they come & go.  My understanding is there are 12 rooms at the"
40,"originally oversold the hotel when arrived in Guatemala needed to move to another hotel on first night on their courtesy of course. Confortable stay .. nice busy hotel, very well located.  rooms are clean ans very confortable."
40,"Rooms are spacious and clean and service is great. The hotel staff is lovely and very helpful, Location is perfect for those who do not know the capital and want to stay in the more touristic part of the city."
50,Our mission team of 20 Has stayed here for the past 2 yrs I find it of very good quality and pricing with a very pleasant and helpful staff. The location is convienient to the airport and shuttle service is provided. Web service is available in the lobby and wireless can be provided.
20,"I stayed for a few days two weeks apart. Both times I was provided a room that looked nothing like the brochure nor website. I dealt with severe allergies due to carpeting, poor air-conditioning, and roaches in the bathroom. The staff is nice but insist on a renovated room on upper floors 4 and 5."
10,"My friend and I took a trip to Guatemala and booked the tour thru Mayan Travels. We were to stay in Biltmore Hotel on 18th of April, 2012, After waiting for 45 minutes to check in we were told that there is a problem and they will transfer us to a different hotel, They sent 2 of us by Spanish speaking cab driver, who was stopping on deserted road mumbling and getting out of the cab. 15 minute ride took 45 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel it was  a room in basement, with no hot water and no breakfast or dinner facility. Even though, we paid for 4 star hotel and accommodation was not even one star. We were scared and Biltmore did not give us any specific reason for our transfer."
40,"We (a large group) stayed here a week while working in The City.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the  private bathrooms are decent.  We had plenty of hot water, but others were complaining of lack of hot water- maybe it's a room-by-room problem?  Wifi was excellent.  Breakfast was ok- the usual- eggs and beans.  But some fruit would have been nice.  Coffee was good, and the pan dulce was great.  The outside sitting area was wonderful.  A couple of cons: no free drinking water and no close restaurants.  We were stuck ordering off the to-go menu- mainly Pollo Campero, Chinese, Mexican and Telepizza- not so great after a week.  Also close to the airport and a military training facility- so not all that quiet, but it didn't keep me awake either."
40,"We stayed just one night in this lovely place ... very well decorated, very clean and nice!!  They have a delicious garden to take the breakfast and dinner or to work if you need (wi-fi works well in the garden). The staff was very good and helpful. Just take care about the room that you choose: we stayed a the room downstairs in front of the reception and this room is noisy. Is better to choose a room upstairs. They provide free pickup from the airport ..."
50,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in early April. We flew in late one evening prior to flying out to Flores early the next morning. Our objectives were to find a nice, solid hotel close to the airport. You will struggle to find a better place if you are looking for something similar.  The hotel is 2 minutes from the airport and the room includes a freee transfer to and from the airport. The hotel is very safe and the rooms are beautifully decorated. The top floor room we requested had a beautiful outdoor terrace overlooking the Italian themed courtyard.  Reception staff were very helpful and friendly."
40,"Stayed there three nights in april 2012, on arrival in Guatemala and before departure. The hotel is very close to the airport: you can walk over in less then 10 minutes. The hotel is located in a safe, guarded area. There are no restaurants around, but the hotel order a lunch or dinner for you. For any restaurant, you must take a cab. The owners and staff are nice and kind. The manager speaks english. The included breakfast is simple but tasty. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Can be noisy if your room is on the first floor, especially if they give you the living room because the hotel is full! There is also some noise coming from outside since the hotel seems to be near a military setting: they get up early and they sing aloud as they exercise!"
40,"Stayed here on my first night in Guatemela (we were on our way to visit a missionary in Shay-la). The triple room we had was very nice and breakfast was good.Since I wasn't feeling well on my last night in the country, I decided to get a private room. They had Room #4 available which had a king sized bed and private bath. It was wonderful and I really appreciated such lovely accomodations at that point in time. The staff is great as others have said!"
20,"Our overall experience with this hotel was average. It has large interior somewhat grandiose spaces and amenities. Food was reasonable and the restaurant staff were great. We encountered frustrating difficulties dealing with the counter staff. We were travelling with a Caravan tour except for the extra day we tagged on to allow us to climb Papaya Volcano (worth the trip). We had to leave early so we ordered a boxed breakfast. At 5.00am on the day of our volcano trip we were told that there were no breakfasts and even if there were we would have to pay extra, having already paid the rate for the room plus breakfast. An unnecessary argument at that time of day is aggravating to say the least. We will never stay there again."
50,"Excellent choice if you are in between flights and you want a very clean and safe place in Guatemala City, close to the airport. The staff is very helpful and discreet, the rooms are big and from the upper floors gives you a beautiful view on the city (I've stayed at the 7th floor)."
50,"This hotel is in a great location, close to airports, shopping, parks and the zoo. The rooms are clean,  well appointed and have nice balconies to enjoy the pretty views of the volcanoes and city lights. We had breakfast and dinner buffets which were excellent in quality and variety. I would definitely stay here again. "
40,"This is a huge complex not far from the airport, about 15 minutes' by Uber to the center of the city. It's a convenient hotel with everything you could need and want. As several travelers have said, it's not a new property, so some elements feel a bit dated. But overall, this didn't detract from my experience.   The breakfast was quite nice. The gym/fitness center was also above average (it's a membership gym as well as serving the hotel).   Would recommend, especially for business travel."
30,"Good for a short stay period, needs remodelarion as some characteristics are too old fashioned. Carpets of the room looks old and smells old. Personnel are very nice. Spaces are comfortable and the localization is good, very close to the airport, and shuttle to reach it is very useful."
30,Large and clean rooms with internal access to nice restaurant and health club in the adjacent Camino hotel. For the price this hotel is a good deal.
10,"There is a nightclub on the first floor that has a 5-piece band playing every night into the early hours of the morning. My room was on the 2nd floor. With no noise insulation in the hotel, it sounded like i had a band in my bathroom, EVERY NIGHT. The management of the hotel doesn't care at all. The front desk keeps saying they'll ""send someone to investigate where the noise is coming from"". They know very well where the noise is coming from. Terribly managed hotel."
30,"I flew in from Miami about 10pm and stayed at the Biltmore Express. There was a very nice free shuttle to the hotel (turn right when you come out of the airport and you should see a man with a sign for Camino Real). There was nothing special about the hotel, but it did the job until I travelled to Copan the next day. Only thing was a large air conditioning unit buzzing away all night, if I hadn't been so tired, I'd have asked to move to a higher floor."
50,The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  The best part was the excellent service that every member of the staff provided.  Everyone seemed to enjoy doing their job.  The continental breakfast included with the price of the room is very delicious.
20,friendly receptionist but uncaring  lovely room but the bathroom leaks internet connection has much to be desired even through we paid for the use of it in our room it is too slow to be of any use  shuttle was offered but details were hard to find unless u want to place an international call costing more money plus their website was down no info to be found there too and when departing the shuttle arrived late  hotel is definitely a work in progress the neighborhood is quite unsafe  bars aplenty around the hotel  drunken or sober fools are not excusable while my friend and i were walking back to the hotel at 7pm we were followed by a car with 2 men propositioning us for several blocks and one of the men got out of the car and accosted us.   no longer felt safe to step out past
50,"The hostal's  great virtue is its closeness to the airport and free taxi service to the airport starting at 5 am.  Our second floor room was super-large with a king size bed,  very comfortable, and had a view of the garden.  This hostal is very good for what it delivers - a safe, clean place to spend the night before flying off to another destination.   We departed 6 am in the morning before breakfast was served and was offered a small bottle of juice and a granola bar.  If you are thinking of exploring Guatemala City during your brief stay here, you will need a taxi."
50,"We stayed at Hostal Villa Toscana after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were glad we did. It is less than 5 minutes from the airport and since we had an early morning flight this enabled us to get a little more sleep the night before leaving in the morning. The staff and owners couldn't have been nicer. The hotel is in a safe, gated neighborhood. After a harrowing ride on van service from Panajachel ( our driver actually rear-ended a truck upon arrival in Guatemala as he was tailgating constantly), it was nice to be greeted warmly at Villa Toscana. They don't have a restaurant that serves dinner  but you can order out from a menu and the hotel will have it delivered. They even set out plates and silverware on the breakfast table for us so we didn't have to eat In our room."
40,Quiet. Close to airport. Helpful service. Thanks for a good stay. 
40,"My wife and I stayed at the Villa Toscana because we had an early morning flight to Tikal.  Plus, the price was reasonable for our short stay. The hostal is literally five minutes from the La Aurora Airport.  The hostal (which is more like a nice small hotel) is located inside a gated area.  The staff at the Villa Toscana were extremely friendly, helpful and spoke excellent Engish.  The place was very clean, it had a nice decor and the room in which we stayed was large with a private bathroom.   The price inludes a breakfast but because our flight was before serving time, the person in charge gave us each a bottle of juice & a breakfast bar to take with us.  I should also note, that for other meals, the hostal will pick-up carry-out food orders for you from their menu.  I am"
50,"I have stayed here several times, for one or two nights at a time. They have always been friendly and helpful with transportation and advice. The staff are very friendly, the location is very convenient to the airport, the showers are hot and the neighborhood seems very safe."
50,"This is a great hotel, you won't be disappointed.  Bed was a little hard but it's great for business, and has a nice sushi bar/Japanese restaurant in the lobby, really good food (I've eaten there several times as I have used this hotel several times for business travel.  It used to be a Marriott."
30,"The property is looking it’s age. Door jambs don’t seal well, paint in the bathroom looks worn. The shower caddy dispenser looks like a motel room and it took a long time to get hot water into the room"
50,"Spent two days here as part of a Caravan Americas Tour of Guatemala.  The hotel was first class in every sense.  impeccable service, great food, safe surroundings.  The hotel had several eating options including Japanese, buffet featuring many Guatemalan dishes along with more continental dishes, and a Strikers Sports Bar serving great hamburgers and other items."
50,The location of the hotel was great.  The pool area and service from the staff was unbelievable.  I had breakfast and it was the best.  The different types of foods were exceptional and the staff was extremely friendly.  
50,"close to the airport and downtown, Barcelo offer just about everything you need. Spent 4 nights recently, whatever small issues we had were fixed right away. Room, breakfast, lunch, bar, stores, everything was ok"
30,"Stayed here over night when flying in from airport before traveling to the Rio Dulce area. It is a plus that they have a no charge airport pickup/drop off.  Nicely presented, free, continental breakfast. Staff was congenial, some were bilingual.  They do charge for internet use.  The rooms were okay but the bathrooms were definitely needed new plumbing.  For same price, there are other hotels that I have found to be superior."
50,We have stayed at the Biltmore numerous times over the past 3 years and each and every time the service and rooms have been excellent.  I have had the front desk make reservations for us on Litegua (bus service) and to perform translation services for me at no charge.  this is an excellent hotel and we have stayed in many through out the world!!
30,"The beds were quite comfy, felt clean.  The breakfast was meh.  The night before we ate at a restaurant called Hacienda Real because the meals at the Westin were out of our price range.  The water pressure is good, our view wasn't great, but what can you expect I guess?  The internet is 83 Quetzales, but bring an ethernet cord because the WiFi doesn't reach the rooms."
50,"We had read that it was a business class hotel so were pleasantly suprised at the nice room and decor. Easy to get used to fresh papaya, pineapple, melons rolls, coffee and more for the continental breakfast. The staff were very pleasant and helpful with suggestions. Best of all, I emailed from Huehue and asked if they could have a taxi waiting for us at 8pm after our 6 hour busride and he was there. The location was also quiet enough to sleep with the window open, love the fresh air at night. (Pool and fitness center are connected to upscale hotel which were happy to allow guests for  a fee use the services.)"
30,"The Bilmore Express is nothing special and is pretty much like all other hotels.  Instead of a queen or king sized bed, we were given a double.  There is a safe in the room which is nice because the crime is outrageous in Guatemala (all of our luggage was stolen from our car within 1 hour of arriving in the city).  The free breakfast was nothing more than cereal and breads, juice and coffee.  The ""leftovers"" from breakfast are left out all day to allow people to finish up the breads.  It had been out so long that there were flies inside the food containers.    When we went to our room, the hallway smelled like urine.  After having the air conditioner on for awhile we realized that the smell was actually the freon from the conditoner.  It gave me a horrible headache so we did not"
50,"I stayed in Villa Toscana for a month and loved it. It's very homey, good service and extremely safe (in a guarded neighborhood). I got to know the family who owns it and they really made me feel comfortable. Actually, I'm not sure what gave them the title ""hostal"" because it's more like a small hotel, but for prices well under the other hotels in the city of this quality."
50,I spent two nights here at the end of a trip to Guatemala in January.  We had a lovely room (No. 1) which was a spacious twin bedded room with a little patio onto the garden.  It was spotlessly clean and the shower had a good supply of very warm water.  The staff were extremely friendly and breakfast was ample and delicious.  We walked to the Archeological Museum (it's about 2 km) and the Artesian Market (touristy and expensive) but took a taxi into the old part of town (cost $8 to the Cathedral).  Food can be ordered in from local takeaways - this was fine by us as we ate in the lovely garden.  There don't appear to be any restaurants nearby.  The taxi to the airport is included in the room rate and took about 3 mintues.
30,nothing special for the expensive price.  But the rooms are clean and the staff very friendly.
50,"Had a short visit to Guatemala City on our way to Roatan so wanted a hotel close to the airport.  When we first arrived, the security around the hotel made us a little nervous.  But, when we got behind the entrance gate, wow!  The staff was excellent and the little hotel was lovely.  Our room was clean.  It was very quite despite being about 5 min. from the airport.  Their transporter was at the airport ontime.  Absolutely no problems with the arrangements.  The included breakfast was in a lovely patio overlooking colorful plantings."
50,"Such a beautiful, comfortable place so convenient to the airport.  Having such a lovely outdoor space is a wonderful bonus."
50,"Stayed here on first night in Guatemala, before traveling out into countryside.  Good pickup from airport.  Great room and common spaces. We enjoyed dinner and buffet Breakfast. We will use again next mission trip.  "
50,"great place for a short stay in the city; close to the airport and convenient restaurants, also has two native shops that carry those things you need to take home as souvenirs to the grandchildren  no mail service  . "
50,"We always enjoy our stays at the Barcelo and always recommend it for a couple of nights in Guate. Rooms are great, service good, breakfast as much as you can eat, plus a really nice pool! Can't think of a better place to unwind and relax after a long flight!"
50,"This hotel is amazing!  We didn't know what to expect so our experience took us by surprise to be surrounded by such an amazing hotel with great employees.  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and when the time comes that we return to Guatemala City I will stay at this hotel  "
50,"We stayed at the Barcelo in Costa Rica, last year and we loved it. So this year we stayed the Barcelo in Guatemala City. Typical of Barcelo properties, it is elegant. Every thing is spotlessly clean. The staff is friendly, helpful, and professional. The restaurants have a great selection items to eat. Every thing is well prepared, and tastefully displayed. If you are going to be in Guatemala, I would recommend the Barcelo."
40,"I stayed with my husband two nights. Great place, free breakfast (buffet, continental--but good enough). Great location, near night clubs and good restaurants. You can use the pool at the adjacent hotel for $10, and internet for $2 for 15 minutes.  Very clean rooms, great AC.   Ask the hotel staff and they will get you a reliable cab driver to take you around town safely and at set prices. Guate is relatively safe, just don't go flashy with tons of jewels and you will be fine."
20,"The staff at the hotel are very nice and kind. However, the rooms have significant setbacks:  1) The towels were very dirty! One has, what I believe, is an old blood stain and the other one has like dirt tracks!  2) Bed covers were visibly dirty. Sheets were ok.  3) Rooms are quite basic and a bit old. There are no 3 pin plugs and you must ask for adapters at reception.  4) And regarding the free breakfast: well it's very skimpy. It includes bread, ham, fruit and cereal.  In summary, for the price of this hotel (USD 103 for me), it's best to go elsewhere."
30,"I just returned from a two weeks business trip to Guatemala, in which I stayed in the Biltmore Express.  The people is friendly, they do all they can to pleased you, but they don’t seems to be trained for that. I came to the hotel a Monday and until next Friday they have never changed the bathroom soaps. I am a saving guy, so I can use the same soaps for a week, but on Friday it was so tiny that the cleaner took one of them and didn’t let me a new one. I called the service desk and asked for a “jaboncillo”, as I have learned, but next day they let me 3 shampoos. I called the service desk again and this time I asked for “Jabón de Tocador”, which is another way to say bathroom soap, but I got nothing. So next day I took the rest of the soap I had and went straight to the reception"
50,"After a stay of two years in Guatemala, (US Peace Corps ten years ago) I could no longer resist going back to this beautiful country.  To my surprise, the Hotel gave me a wonderful homecoming reception at the airport, imagine :at 11:30PM. Transportation to the hotel was illuminated by the Christmas lights and decorations that are so typical to Guatemala at this time.  Attentiion at the hotel was superb, the room was impeccable, the hotel freshly aired and very well located.  We really enjoyed the traditional courtesy of the hotel personnel from  Desk to Shuttle driver.  The atmosphere and surroundings are those of   a much, much more expensive hotel.   To  sum it up, both my wife and myself  are planning our next trip to Guate and the Biltmore Hotel is number one in the list.  I"
50,"I stayed at the Villa Toscana B&B from december 20th to the 23rd and was impressed. The service and kindness were excellent and the bedrooms were clean, spacious and comfortable.  I needed hair product to fix my hair and the owner offered me some of her own so I wouldn't have to go look for and spend money on mine. These people know how to make you feel at home when you're away from home :) I work at a Marriott Hotel and knowing about hospitality standards I can definitely recommend Villa Toscana for your stay at Guatemala City! PS: The breakfast (included in price) was delicious."
40,"Friendly, comfortable.  About 2 minutes drive or 10-minutes walk from airport."
40,"I stayed here for a night on my way to Xela. It's super close to the airport making it an ideal place to stay overnight while in transit either to or from your flight. Also, the airport isn't very busy so the planes didn't cause me any trouble trying to sleep.    The pictures on trip advisor do the hotel a great service. It's not as good looking in person and the single room is quite small, but it's super clean and the staff, especially Daniel and Asusana, couldn't be nicer.   Definitely recommend it for someone on a budget but who doesn't want to stay in a hostel (despite what name). "
50,My wife and I stayed here after missing a flight to the U.S.  We needed somewhere for just one night.  They picked us up at the airport within minutes.  Upon arrival we were given first class treatment.  It was late afternoon and we hadn't eaten since breakfast.  The owners promptly showed us menus of some local establishments with reasonably priced and delicious typical food.  Each dish was only $7 and it was delivered  within a 1/2 hour.  The rooms were very well maintained and very clean.  The breakfast was typical Guatemalan and was included in the price.  The hotel also took us to the airport the next day at no additional charge.  We will definetly use this hotel again.
40,"I stayed in this little hostal for 2 nights, and could recommend it to anyone who is on a budget and doesn't mind being a little far from the ""action"" (taxi to Zona 10 is currently about 7 dollars) Met me at the airport (included) as promised, which was nice as it might be a little tough to find if you had never been here before. It is in a part of town that feels a little remote at night, but the hotel is at the end of a street that is gated and guarded 24 hrs. The hotel itself feels very safe, and the staff is helpful, friendly and bi-lingual. My room would be small for 2 people, but I think the other rooms are larger. Breakfast was included and nice, and served in the small dining room or outside in the garden where you can smoke (yes, I still smoke :-( ) Shower was warm, but"
50,"The hotel provided excellent service. Reception was friendly, quick and knowledgeable, the room was well decorated and clean, the breakfast was good, wi-fi worked very well, wake-up was punctual, the bar was well stocked  "
50,"We were in town for a sporting event for my daughter. This hotel is less than a ten minute drive from the airport. Hotel shuttle picked us up and is scheduled to take us back. This is super helpful. All the normal amenities in the room such as hair dryer, iron and board, shampoo, shaving kit, etc, as well as bathrobes. The room is a good size, clean, service we have had so far has been excellent- check in, room service, service at buffet breakfast, shuttle driver- all very good. Food on room service appears to be similar to what you would pay in an American restaurant. Hotel has three restaurants, a large bar area in the lobby, swimming pool with hot tub, gift shop. We walked to a grocery store around the corner and there is a McDonalds right beside the hotel. This area also has"
40,"Big hotel with great lobby, good restaurant with large buffet. Very friendly personnel. The hotel is located near the airport and close to the musea popol vuh,ixchel and archeological museum. Lots of business people. Nice rooms with excellent beds. "
30,"Location is good.  Reception at check in was terrible.  We were given a room where sheets were on the floor, dirty towels on the bathroom floor.  After we were given a room that was made up, the bathroom amenities were lacking.  Should 2 people sharing a room also share 1 toothbrush?  "
40,"Centrally located.  Nice and clean and has all the amenities. Peasant staff and good service.I was impressed with their buffet restaurant with a great selection of healthy, fresh and tasty food. The rooms were quite basic but were clean and good sized"
50,"We stayed here August, 2011 one night.  Basically the place lives up to the good reviews.  We arrived after a long bus ride and taxi ride...they served us breakfast the morning we arrived even though we got there long after 9AM.  It is very close to the airport, but there aren't that many flights, and noise was not a problem.  There's a beautiful back yard with covered dining area along one side, a living room, a computer with free internet.  It's all as it appears on the web page.  I'd like to add that the location is very convenient to the Archeaology Museum...and not that far from Zona 10, which has two superior museums, Popol Vuh and Ixchel.  They're just a short taxi ride away, and even if you have only a few hours to spend, definitely visit Popol Vuh and Ixchel.  There are"
50,"We decided to splurge ($61) our last night in Guatemala and stayed in the top floor suite at Villa Toscana. It is wonderfully elegant and comfortable with a lovely deck with bright flowering plants. The owners are accommodating and friendly and there are a variety of rooms at different cost points, all good value. We stayed in a different room earlier in the trip and free airport shuttles were provided both times. A nice pancake or tipico breakfast in a lovely setting is included.  In the past we've stayed our last night in Antigua even with a fairly early flight out but the convenience and stress relief of a free, reliable, 5 minute shuttle to the airport can't be overstated. Highly recommended!"
50,"Flying in or out of Guatemala is so much easier when i book at Villa Toscana.  The owners are very helpful, making the airport experience completely bearable.  Thanks !"
40,"We stayed one night (on Monday) in this conveniently located, friendly hotel with a charming small garden.Our room was spacious and comfortable. As there is are no A.C. or fan it might get a bit hot in warmer months. We heard the planes and the street noise but fortunately the airport is not very busy and traffic not heavy. We also heard music from the disco but it stopped around 10PM. Breakfast was very tasty (a choice of three sets). Jolanta and Louis from Canada"
40,"We spent one night in Guatemala City and were glad we chose the Villa Toscana. It is basic but clean and comfortable, with a pretty little courtyard where they serve breakfast. They picked us up at the airport and also had no problem rising at 5:00 the next morning to bring us back there for an early flight to Tikal.  The young woman who checked us in was very friendly and helpful--and she spoke English, which made everything easier. She also set us up with a driver to take us around a bit and helped us find a place for dinner. The hotel is very close to the artisans market and a supposedly nice restaurant, but these close at 5:00 so had to go further out for our limited sight-seeing. Walking around the central market was a great introduction to Guatemala!"
50,"weekend get away with my grandson we when to the zoo we used the texi service that was at the hotel that really worked well for us the room service was slow but the food was good, we will plan on using this company again in other countries are next trip is to Salvador in may"
50,WiFi is slow. Nice place but maybe it is time to start planning some renovations. The breakfast was very good and the view is also nice. Didn’t have time to try the bar or the pool but they looked nice. 
40,This was my second experience staying in Barcelo while visiting Guatemala. I think it's a very nice hotel. The buffet breakfast and dinners are excellent. Definitely would recommend it. Has a nice pool as well.
50,"A nice hotel. Great value I think, and conveniently located. Very friendly staff. Very comfortable room. A bit dated but very clean and comfortable. My room had 2 balconies, but since it was on the 3rd floor the view wasn’t spectacular but that’s ok. Great breakfast but a bit pricey if it’s not included but McDonalds next door has good breakfast too.  The room could have used a refrigerator (it has a minibar) but everything else was perfect. "
40,"This trip was mainly for business porpuses the service and accomodation was far beyond my expectations. On the 18 of february i traveled to Guatemala city and was very welcomed to Barcelo, which i stayed until the 22 of february my experience there was great hoping to be back sooner or later."
50,"This is actually a great bed and breakfast. The rooms are clean and spacious, showers hot and wonderful hospitality. The breakfasts are very good. Although they do not cook lunch or supper, they have a delivery menu that features Mexican, Italian and Chinese foods at good value. They arrive to the charming dining room piping hot. The hostel also has a supply of pop and beer.There is a courtyard that has an area with tables and chairs that is covered. Internet use is free. Although the city can be daunting, the location is in the better part of town and it is safe and easy to walk to the zoo, museums ,markets and a modern downtown area."
50,"very nice place, the best of 10 hostals i've been in 2 weeks, Clean, safe and confortable. few blocks from airport."
40,"We stayed at Hostel Villa Toscana 2 nights.  The staff was excellent, the room was nice, and airport transportation and breakfast are included!  A great place to stay!"
50,"This is my 3rd time to stay at this hotel. Every time the customer service, food and accommodations have exceeded my expectations.  I visit Guatemala City often, and will stay at this hotel every time!  Thanks for a great stay!"
50,"We enjoyed our stay at this family run, close to the airport B & B very much.  They accommodated our every wish, including treating us to some locally made mole, a polite wake up knock on the door to awake us for our early morning ride to the airport, and giving us special baggage stands in our room to name just a few examples of their thoughtfulness.  We were given information about sights to see and activities to do in the short time we were there before leaving the country.  Please don't skip this place.  It is a perfect and delightful place to stay before beginning and/or ending your wonderful stay in Guatemala."
50,"I had a great stay of more than a week at this B and B. It had everything I needed for a busy business trip. The rooms are clean, have wifi, television, private bathrooms (in most cases), and comfortable, tasteful furniture. There's a very pleasant backyard sitting area, good breakfast, delivery options for dinner and a couple small stores within safe walking distance where you can buy anything from water to mobile phones.     Most importantly, the inn is run by a very friendly and knowledgeable family that provides excellent advice on how to get around town or find transportation around the country. Though a family business, it maintains professional standards. They also pick you up and drop you off at the airport, which is less than five minutes away.     The hotel is only"
50,"I stayed at this hostal for 3 nights. It only opened 3 years ago. The rate for a single (sencillo) was $33 per night. This included breakfast, free airport transfers (no wonder, it's 5 min away by car!), and free Internet. The hostal is in Zona 13 which isn't the safest. You won't want to walk around the surrounding neighborhoods at night. But, they have closed-circuit cameras, a locked gate, and I felt extremely safe.  After a lighting storm one night, the Internet went out but it was back on again the next morning.  If you don't have a laptop and just want to read email, there is a computer for your use in the lobby connected to Internet.  There are two wireless access points, one upstairs and one downstairs, so you're assured of good signal. There is a beautiful courtyard in"
40,"My wife and I stayed just the one night at Villa Toscana.  We were arriving in Guatemala City by collectivo from Antigua and had arranged to be picked up by the hotel at the airport.  Unfortunately traffic problems got in the way and we were 45 minutes late for the designated meeting time.  Not surprisingly there was no one to meet us, and as we didn't know where the hostal was we got a taxi - 40 pesos.  Couldn't believe it when he drove about 250 metres, and there we were - easiest 40 pesos he's ever made! (One of those fancy limousine cars that frequent airports wanted to charge us US$20 for the trip!)  The hostal was clean and, as others have remarked, run by a very friendly family.  The place is nothing fancy, but it is homely.  There was a computer near the reception area"
20,"My fiance and I stayed here after a week in Antigua and Tikal as a pit stop while waiting for a flight the following morning. A couple of thoughts: -Very sketchy location. We live in a bad Brooklyn neighborhood and both of us decided to stay in. -There was some sort of outdoor discoteque down the block. Very loud until 2am on a Saturday night.  -No air conditioning or fans so we had to leave the sliding door and windows open -About the exact time the music stopped, we got invaded by Mosquitos. (no screens on the windows or sliding door.) -No phones in the rooms so it requires someone to knock for wakeup calls.  -No one knocked for our scheduled wakeup call.  -No soap dish and insane, painful needle-like water pressure in the shower -Food menu is actually mostly from a local fast"
50,Stayed here with my 10 year old daughter for 5 days. Very friendly and helpful staff. Taxi were there within a few minutes and the rates were much lower than when I got one myself. Rooms were very clean and breakfast was very tasty. We ordered delivery several nights and it came promptly. I will stay here again next time I visit Guatemala City.
50,This is an upmarket hotel in the city centre catering to luxury tourists and business travelers.  We found: - the room to be large and clean - the hotel rooms to match the foyer. So it is not one of those places that spend all their money on a fancy lobby for the first impression and the website and then gives you a terrible room - the linen to be brilliant. Really great towels and very big. - the location to be fantastic. Close to the airport (they have a shuttle which was actually there and waiting) and close to fast food and a supermarket.  This place is very deserving of a five out of five rating.
40,"Great 4 to 5 star hotel.  Excellent service, great food in their restaurants.  Very nice rooms.  Beside to look for a room above floor 5.  Much better city and mountain views on floor seven and above.  Hotel is very nicely laid out.  Very clean."
50,Mesrby the airport. Has everything a tourist may need. Grest breakfast and dinner. Rooms very convient and larg. The gim is a little bit small but has sll ewuipment needed. Staff was good and polite.  Certainly hotel to return to.
40,Great location room was well maintained  Bed was so comfortable sheets great Quality All amenities that you will need toothbrush shave kits shower caps sewing kits only complaint I have is they don’t replace if you stay a few night still need shower cap for second night etc  Breakfast was good omelettes made to perfection  lots of choices coffee very good  We ate dinner in restaurant with buffet lots of choices and you can order À la cart price fairly food good  Front desks staff were nice  We had access to the executive level it was Definitely worth it sandwiches all day alcohol drinks available after five lots of fresh fruits soda water snacks  Location good for walking to many  restaurant and nice shopping mall  Would use this chain again  
50,"Had to stop here on my way home to USA. This hotel has American Airlines office in the lobby. Also Delta (if I remember right). It has a shuttle but get there early because my morning I left the line was very long.. Excellent rooms! You will need your keycard for elevator, to turn on bathroom lights so keep it handy.. So close to airport... McDonalds next door is very nice..."
50,"This was my second visit to Guatemala.  The Hostal Villa was like the Ritz Carlton compared to the hostal I stayed in the year prior.  The people were wonderful, we had great computer access and the food was yummy.  Also, no ""widow-makers"" in the shower.  I was thankful!  I can't wait to go back and stay again!"
50,"In staying at the Hostal Villa Toscana, I experienced the kind of treatment and care that you might expect when visiting a close family.  From the time you walk in the door to the time you leave they made us all feel so at home and welcomed. The rooms were extremely clean and always comfortable.  The location felt warm and cozy and to the point of being comfortable walking around the place in my socks and feeling comfortable. I am extremely pleased with their care and service they provided.  The best part about it is their willingness to jump at any need and get it resolved quickly and with a great smile.  Very grateful we had such a great place to stay after working long hard hours. Bless this family and staff for all they do to serve so many."
50,"I'm staying at this nice hostal every time I'm going to Guatemala, usually twice a year. Some times I bring with me a gruop of norwegian tourists.   I always feel like comming home!  The host and the stuff are very friendly and serviceminded. They have a great hospitality at Villa Toscana, and the host and the stuff always do whatever they can to please you and fulfill your wishes! I always  recommend this hostal to those who are travelling to Guatemala City!"
50,My sisters and I stayed there for one night in December. We would have stayed longer but our limited time didn't allow us to stay longer. They were extremely helpful in planning and booking our trip to different destinations in Guatemala. We had an idea of places we wanted to see and they made great suggestions for additions to our itinerary.  I would highly recommend this gem to anyone wanting to stay in Guatemala city.
50,"The hotel is great, the staff is better and the location is good.  Totally satisfied."
40,"When I found the free shuttle service to the hotel, I was told that I needed to have notified them in advance that I was coming.  When I pointed out that I was there NOW and so was the shuttle, this was not viewed as a compelling argument since the shuttle was waiting for the crew from the flight I have just exited.  I told the driver that I would consult with the crew and see if they were willing to let them ride with them, which of course turned out to be no problem.  The hotel itself is fine, very much like hotels all over the world.  In short, it is not my taste, but served my purposes well as I left early the next morning for Antigua.  I did meet a very nice and helpful taxi driver at the hotel who drove me to Antigua."
50,"If you need an airport hotel, this is a great choice. I stayed only for two nights, so can not comment on the area, but it may be a good choice even if you do not need the airport. The breakfast was excellent!!! Stuff really kind, free airport shuttle. If I'm to return to Guatemala city I would definitely consider staying in Barcelo again. "
50,This hotel was recommended by a friend and it WAS PERFECT. The staff was incredibly helpful. The Room was terrific. The stay was delightful. I would return here in a minute and would recommend to any traveler to Guatemala.
50,"I recommend this hotel, but not the sport bar (be carefull with the food); the other restaurants are really good... beside the sport bar, the installations are nice (lobby, room, etc)...  good attention"
50,"Very nice hotel.  Good wifi and hot showers.  Quiet rooms despite being right off the airport runway.  Literally five minutes from the airport.  Convenient shopping within walking distance.  Good restaurant.  Helpful, knowledgeable, bi-lingual staff.  I would stay here again."
50,The hotel was very nice with good amenities for the price.   Convenient to the airport and local restaurants.  It was very clean and speedy service getting MANY folks checked in.   We came as a large group and another group was ahead of us and the check in time was minimal considering the amount of folks checking in.   Very helpful in converting money as well.
40,"Room was high end but drain was slow to empty,bed was a little past due date need to be changed,the sheet were wonderful,staff were excellent.they should have a place on the roof for guests to view the nearby volcano"
30,"We stayed here for one night after vacationing in the mountains.  The room was great—nice bedding, large bath with separate toilet room, robes and slippers.  Fee van to the airport went on time and was very convenient.  The “fanciest” of the three restaurants is Japanese.  We went there for dinner.  Our appetizer took over half an hour to come, and we did not get our entrees without reminding the waiter, who claimed the kitchen was overwhelmed.  Hard to fathom in a half empty restaurant.  When it finally came, my stir fried veg and shrimp in noodle in spicy miso sauce was a gloppy mess.  The four shrimp had obviously been cooked previously, not stir fried, and were over cooked and gummy.  Not a bit of spice.  My husband”s sea bass and veggies included a bed of stone cold"
10,"We had no hot water following a early morning flight hoping to shower.  The shower had no hot water until 8 pm which we weren't informed of which is poor for a 5 star hotel. They then sent a printed email saying it would be ready as soon as possible an hour after we told them.  I understand things go wrong but hotels are in the service business to put things right. They could have provided a gesture of goodwill such as dinner or compensation on the room to put this right but gave nothing, not even an apology over the phone.  Having stayed at barcelo San Jose previously that was a good stay but seeing as I have sent a complaint to the barcelo chain customer service this apathy in poor service is clearly endemic in the entire company so I will choose to stay at one of their"
50,"Excellent value for price, comfortable, friendly helpful staff. Buffet meals in La  Vista offer very good food, sampling of local flavors, and good choices for any dietary challenges.  Tip: remember to bring a washcloth!"
50,"Once again the Toledo family welcomed us into what we view as our home in Guatemala.  It is so nice to know that a safe, clean, comfortable place awaits us only moments from the airport.  Thank you to all the family and staff for taking such good care of us."
30,"We spent one night at Villa Toscana before going to Antigua, and a second night before returning home.  Villa Toscana is both inexpensive and very comfortable.  They met us as promised at the airport and arranged a driver to take us to the bank and a store.  Although they don't serve dinner, they have menus that allow you to order for nearby restaurants who deliver the food to the hotel.  We were surprised to see a computer for use by guests, with free internet service.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly and helpful.  Breakfast, which was included in the room price, was good with two choices, local and American type.  We tried both.  There is good security. The staff arranged for our transportation to Antigua.  I would recommend Villa Toscana,."
50,"This family owned and operated hostal makes sure you are happy,  starting with the excellent pickup service at the airport, to the tasty breakfast to get your day going. The bi-lingual staff can help with any travel questions, they are truly service oriented.  Wireless internet a big plus for me. It's my favorite place to be when flying in or out of Guatemala, never a disappointment."
40,I stayed here recently for 5 nights with my 12 year old son. The staff here are incredibly warm and friendly and can organise tours and taxis etc.  The rooms are beautifully decked out and comfortable.  It is a stone's throw from the airport which from our prospective was ideal.  Breakfast was tasty and dinner can be ordered in.
40,"The hotel and their staff were helpful, always ready to accommodate. Breakfast was great and the rooms were clean and comfortable."
40,Great hotel! Everything thing was top notch from room cleanliness to the staff being courteous.Got to do a little shopping within the hotel along with having a very good cuppuccino. Only down side room was not as cool as I liked. Fellt warm during the night.
30,"We stayed at Barcelo for one night in January of 2019, and it was OK. Positives were the helpful staff and the incredibly professional and reliable airport shuttle.  Negatives were weird hammering noises outside our room in the night, kind of a generally weird vibe in the hotel, and TSUNAMI like water pressure. Both the showers and taps unleashed tsunami of water like no other upon use. While unique and humorous, it made tasks like showering or brushing one’s teeth rather difficult."
50,"We stayed 4 nights at the Barcelo in January 2019. It is a very comfortable and well run hotel with excellent service, well appointed rooms and top notch food in the La Vista restaurant. Highly recommend it. "
10,not good reception staffs and I have a very bad experience with their hotel pick up. I have got a mail from them and will not keep their words. The reception staffs are not friendly and will not ready to wish us in the proper manner. I was visited the country for the first time and all other facilities are good except the hotel reception staffs
40,"We loved the hotel. It was clean, the free shuttle was great, the breakfast had many options .We didn't like the loud music after 11pm on Saturday night or the cold room service food. We could hear everything from the room beside us too (annoying). But overall, it is a very good hotel if you need something close to the airport ."
50,"My husband and I recently stayed here overnight after arriving on a late night flight. He had stayed here before and wanted to bring me back. The family that runs the hotel are so friendly and helpful. We ended up bringing a large group back to the hotel at the end of the week. Everyone in our group loved the facilities and enjoyed relaxing there before heading home. The innkeepers helped us order dinner for our large group and helped accomodate everyone perfectly. The location to the airport is another plus. We will definitely be back in the near future. The rooms are clean, safe, relaxing and pleasant."
50,"I was in this hotel during april and may for my bachelors graduation project. Here I had the comfort and leisure needed to complete my assigments and enjoy companionship of the nice family running this hotel. Besides the fact that they were very friendly they also offered a service which was unknown to me. The breakfast was good, the beds were good and I had good internet connection. And you were allowed to use the sauna, swimingpool and the gym and a nearby hotel (5minute walk). And they always smiled and so I will be leaving with a smile aswell. I want to thank this beautifall flower for this wonderfull stay, when I come back my first night has to be here!"
50,"Right near the airport this charming hotel was everything that you could need - comfortable beds, free internet, with a very friendly and helpful family that catered to our every need! Highly recommended."
40,I was picked up at the airport by the father of the family who was very nice and welcoming. They helped me find the right bus and bus schedule. There was free internet and the breakfast was good.
50,"I chose this place based on great reviews here on TA, and wasn't disappointed. I emailed them a few hours before arrival, from an airport. Then, at my second airport, while changing planes, I checked my email and had already received a reply. They picked us up at the airport with a sign with my name on it, drove us to the hotel where someone opened a big gate and closed it behind the car, giving us a very secure feeling (although the particular area where the hotel is is apparently not too unsafe).  There were two rooms available: one with two twin beds and its own bathroom which was outside of the room ($48.80 US), and a ""suite"" with a huge king bed, nice bathroom in the room, and a huge patio deck with a view of volcanoes ($61), which we chose for the relatively small"
50,Convenient to airport for next day departure for us. Many choices of dining available right in hotel. All very good to excellent. The bar service was a little high compared to the rest of Guatemala but our Mojito was one of the best.
50,Very nice rooms with balconies.  Forget to pack something?  They have it for you.  Great Breakfast buffet. Heated pool....poolside lounging plus pool bar/ cafe. Friendly staff.  Attentive service. Airport shuttle.
40,"Booked with Gate 1 tour. Close to airport. Walking distance to Avenida de la Reforma. Short cab ride to restaurants; close walk too. A bit longer ride to historic center. Nice rooms. Comfy beds, comfy pillows.  AC  & showers work well. Really nice breakfast buffet. Business/concierge office. Very high praise & thanks to Fernanda Gonzalez who helped us alot with tours & restaurants. One small note; we stayed 2x in 2 wks. First room on 7th floor nicer view. Second time on 4th floor. Note to manager  please update blowdryer in 404. Yes we recommend this hotel."
50,I’ve stayed here many times and I love the consistent good service and comfort. It Is also a good place to stay fly into and out of Guatemala City. I believe this hotel used to be a Marriott and it still has the consistency and comfort at the Marriott.
50,Great hotel with super beds and close to airport and other attractions .Everything worked just fine and staff speaks very good English and where helpful!Sunshine area at the pool area.Airport shuttle free of charge.
50,This is a very wonderful family run inn. The family is quite friendly and fun to get to know. The room was very comfortable and clean. The breakfast was excellant as was the atmosphere. I enjoyed my stay here very much and will certainly stay here on future trips to Guatemala City. I loved everything about this inn.
50,"I found this B&B on tripadvisor, and we were very pleasantly surprised by how nice it was.  The room was adequate with 2 double beds and cable tv.  Free internet access was available.  A good pancake breakfast.  We got a free trip to the airport which is less than 5 minutes away.  I expected to hear noise from airplanes flying overhead, but only heard planes twice and not during the night.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  It is a real bargain.  They don't recommend walking the neighborhood for dinner, but they have menus for various places nearby who deliver food at a reasonable cost.  It is so convenient and less expensive than Zone 10 that I plan to stay there for future visits."
50,"Very clean and wonderful breakfasts.  The best part is the friendly staff and family atmosphere.  They have a nice courtyard where one can sit and enjoy the sunshine or visit with fellow travelers.  There is some noise because of proximity to the airport, but I did not find this to be a big issue."
50,"Our group has stayed here twice within the past 2 years and each time we have felt very welcomed by the family atmosphere. On our first stay we had 20 people and on our second 12. The rooms are large and clean, the breakfasts delicious, and the owners extremely accomodating to our schedule. Avoid the major chain hotels. If you really want to get the flavor of Guatemalan hospitality, you will want to stay here."
50,"We loved staying at hostel villa toscana. It is a very friendly, family run hotel, with spacious, comfortable and very clean rooms. The hotel is about 3 mins drive from the airport and the staff will pick you up if pre-arranged.   Everyone was very helpful, getting our laundry washed and dried in just a few hours, allowing us to leave some luggage for a week while we did some more travelling (for a small fee), sorting out future accommodation for us, carrying our bags, and picking us up from the airport.  The breakfast was delicious too.   Would recommend staying there if you need somewhere close to the airport."
50,"We stayed here for one nite after flying in from the states. The shuttle from the airport was awesome, very comfortable and safe. The hotel itself is beautiful with the luxury of some 4/5 star hotel/resorts in the states. The check in process was friendly and very quick. Staff very helpful with our 9 luggage’s. Room was very clean, comfortable and luxurious. Views from our room were beautiful of the city and the volcanos. Breakfast was amazing!!!! Very typical Spanish breakfast foods and so much to choose from! We would definitely stay here again and also recommend to anyone! "
50,"Great place to stay! Excellent location, People was amazing, excelent breakfast, nice bar and lobby, pool was clean. Price are correct. Parking lot and transfers to airport free. It was a nice experience."
50,The room was clean and comfortable. The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. Breakfast was great too. Loved the omelette station and fresh juices. Wish we had more time to enjoy this hotel and it's amenities.
50,"This hotel is amazing! Friendly staff, strong wifi, amazing food, great price, and great atmosphere. My wife and I will definitely be back! The staff made the stay great. My wife and I also received a complimentary bottle of rum for their New Years celebration! Great Hotel!!"
40,"They can be ridiculous about 30 dollars worth of laundry, the rest of the staff is friendly. They forget that a happy guest come back.Hotel amenities, gift shops, restaurants are nice, even live music at Strikers, the sports bar."
50,"It was very comfortable.  the friendly staff treated us like family.  the pancakes in the morning were great, and we loved being able to eat in the sun.  very easy to get to the airport.  the rooms are more like a hotel than a hostel, with cable tv and a balcony! it is clean, the security is good, we highly recommend it"
50,"I have now stayed twice at the Hostal Villa Toscana, a lovely, family owned hotel close to the airport. I have stayed alone and with a group and in both cases found the hotel very comfortable, accommodating and enjoyable in every way. For a group there is an enclosed terrace behind the hotel (but still secure within its walls) for group meeting and meals. The rooms are comfortable. Take in food such as pizza and chicken are easily arranged. There is access to the internet. Most importantly, the Toledo family is extraordinarly friendly, helpful and absolutely reliable. I have stayed in other hotels in Guatemala city, but after the past two trips, I wouldn't even consider another hotel."
50,"We stayed over at Villa Toscana before our flight out, and it is HIGHLY recommended. Our room was spacious, clean, and nicely put together, and the beds were very comfortable. There was also real hot water.   The owner was incredibly friendly, and helped us recover a passport inadvertently left on a plane.    We left too soon for the breakfast, but there was a kitchen available for use, and a fridge full of beer and other beverages for purchase.    This hotel is near the airport, so there's not a lot else around, but if you need a place to stay at the beginning or end of your trip, I highly recommend Villa Toscana."
50,"While I was only in Guatamala City for a night, it was a wonderful stay. Everyone was so attentive and responsive. The spa manager (whose name I did not get unfortunately) was incredibly accommodating with my extremely last minute massage request and I am so very grateful. Abigale the massage therapist worked out all the tension that my new pair of shoes had caused me and I’m a happier human being because of her! Room service was fast and hit the spot! I hope to come back! Thank you again!"
40,"We arrived in Guatemala City at 10:30 pm after a long flight and we were somewhat apprehensive given the reputation of the city for violence (""don't go outside,"" an airport guard said.  ""It's dangerous."") and the fact that we were traveling with children.  But there was a hotel shuttle waiting for us when we left customs and it brought us directly to the hotel which was a very hospitable place.  It's ornate, and large, and the staff is very kind and attentive.  I felt welcomed which I really valued.  The rooms (we were in two) were very comfortable and clean.  The breakfast was ... superlative.  I was grateful to have  Hotel Barcelo waiting for us and I would recommend it to anyone.  "
50,"Excellent place to spend quality time with your family. Very attentive staff with evryday details at your room. I would love to visit this place again. The food is pretty good, with three restaurants inside, our favorite was the Sushi restaurant."
50,My stay at this hotel was an excellent experience. The hotel offers all the amenities of a five stars hotel at a very affordable price. I will definitely recommend it to my relatives and friends. I’ll stay here in my next visit to Guatemala and I will look for other locations in my travevelling managed or own by this company.
50,"I've stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City many, many times and never disappointed. I used room service this time and got a pedi in the salon. Both were excellent. Unfortunately I did't bring my bathing suit this trip, but wished I had. I love the pool. Especially swimming at night. I always try to get a room facing the volcanoes. I was able too both my stays, coming into Guatemala and the night before leaving. The breakfast buffet is to die for. I have never stayed anywhere that had this awesome of a breakfast buffet."
50,"We stayed there for 3 nights.  Everything was top quality,  Drinks were expensive, but again top quality.  Buffet is very good and a lovely veranda.  Massages were very inexpensive and a welcome treat after a long flight.  I fell sick our last day (no fault of the hotel).  They responded immediately with first aid and an offer of an ambulance."
40,"Very Good ang kingness atention, the services was very good, excellent location, close to international airport and down town, very good transportation service from airport to hotel, fast check out, very good experience¡"
50,"Excellent hotel with excellent service, room was very clean, lots of hot water, Lobby bar was very good for our needs, my roommate used the pool and thought it was wonderful, shops are nice and well priced."
40,"Solid 4 stars. Nice rooms, great lobby, 2 restaurants, large pool, gym, just off Av La Reforma. ATM in lobby, safe in room, normal amenities. Within walking distance of Plaza Espana, other restaurants, and business zones."
40,I would definitely stay here again.  I love the two-story suite which was very roomy and comfortable with amazing views.  I love the remote-controlled black out curtains. the pool was very warm and clean and the jacuzzi was perfect. I love that there's always a life-guard on duty. 
50,"My first visit several years ago was a little disappointing, but I tried them again - much better! The beds are much more comfortable and the WiFi is now free.  I like the Guatemalan options on the dining menu as well. "
40,My room was on the 10th floor with an amazing view of the city and sunset. Felt safe and comfortable on hotel grounds. Very convenient for airport connection w free shuttle. Food and drink and hotel restaurants were very good. I would stay here again for sure.
50,The old Marriott is now the Barcelona. Nothing has changed  and it is as welcoming as it was years ago. A great price for what you get. Restaurants in the Joel as well as near by are great. We stay here when we have an early flight out the next day.
50,"Everything about the hotel made me feel very comfortable on my first visit to Guatemala. The room was very clean and the staff very responsive to our needs. The breakfast buffet provided a great variety of items, which were very good. The gym had plenty of exercise equipment which I used several times during my stay. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
40,"I like this place for it's proximity to the airport, it's cleanliness, the comfort of it's beds, and the friendly staff.  The internet works well in the rooms..  When they are available the 2 story duplex suits are amazing.  Down side, there web site is a nightmare.  You can't reach tec support from any phone number I have found, and I am still struggling to get my last stay added to my my becelo points, even though they sent me a survey, and I have a confirmation number."
50,Lots of Traffic I would suggest Taxi or UBER.  We went to the mall and it was very nice.  Went to Antigua for shopping and visited a coffee plantation there.  The worst part of the trip was Spirit Airlines to and from and it was a straight thru flight with a 3 hour delay with no explanation.
50,This hotel is very close to the airport and has an excellent service is great for the value. i stayed here everytime i can i highly recomend it .the are is safe and the rooms are spacious clean and  very confortable.
50,The best hotel in Central America so far. Taxi Driver took us for a tour of the city. he was very polite and responsible. Will definitely visit Guatemala again mainly because of the service provided by the Hotel. can't wait to return.
50,"I was in the hinderlands of Guatemala for 3 weeks and treated myself to two nights at the Barcelo. I'm so glad I did. The shower was great. Hot tub, food, ambiance, stores, grand piano and music in the evening...All awesome. The maids were helpful and thorough. I had a balcony that was really appreciated. My only complaint is the restaurant: When  ordered off the menu the food took anywhere from 20-30 minutes to arrive. Sandwiches, Entree's, desserts - everything. Meanwhile the buffet is fully loaded but quite spendy. I chose this Hotel from a recommendation and the fact that it had a free airport shuttle. The shuttle was on time, on the hour right out front and suitcases were loaded by the driver (tip him!). It took 10-15 minutes to arrive at the Departure Terminal."
50,They need improve costumer service at reception but after that I love that place It’s a nice place to enojoy with family and friends any kind of event or meeting .The service on the bar was pretty great!!! 
40,The Barcelo is a very good venue  for relaxing in a comfortable surround.  The staff is very nice and friendly and is always ready to accommodate the reasonable requests of guests to make their stay an enjoyable experience. 
50,"Every thing was very good... parking, valet, reception, room service, the buffet breakfast, Strikers for supper, the hotel staff was friendly, the reception checkout and the shuttle to the airport the day we left was efficient."
50,A lovely hotel where everything works.The rooms were big & bright. The beds comfortable.The staff friendly & professional.Breakfast food was varied & delicious .This is a great hotel for business or pleasure.
50,"This is a nice hotel and I'd recommend it. The breakfast buffet is fair as most of the pastries or breads put out are dry, but the hotel itself is very nice and the staff is anxious to please. Since I didn't go out and walk around, i can't say anything about how convenient the location was but i was there mostly to see the country not the city"
50,The hotel has great wifi and the rooms are large and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was also excellent. There is a fitness centre were guests can do exercise classes for free.  I would recommend it especially to people traveling to work and need to spend more time in the hotel. It has all the facilities.
50,Great rooms--reasonable prices--excellent buffet breakfast. The hotel was really accommodating (they let me check in at 10 AM!). The amenities were great. Staff was kind. This was my best hotel experience in Guatemala City.
40,"Good location, service at reception is great and excellent breakfast, you also have other option around to eat. The hotel has a nice pool and also a gym. Upgrading the gym with new equipment would also be a good point for the future. A lot of business travelers and then a good gym is FREE."
20,We arrive at the hotel in our friends car. I don’t if the type of the car was not that luxury as the bellboys are used to receive because there was someone from the staff outside. He saw us getting all of our luggage outside the car and he didn’t even got closer to help us out. We had to talk with him asking for help. Not a regular welcome that you receive when you arrive. The receptionist was kind as a robot and gave us the information about our room. Breakfast was good all the buffet. The room was comfy and ok for the price we have paid. Our flight was super early so we asked for a breakfast( fruits or yogurt) one of the receptionist told us that we should pay like $18 dolars for something that was supposed to be included or just some fruits. And we asked again to another
50,"Barceló Guatemala City is near the Airport. The rooms and amenities are amazing, the rooms are very clean and  confortable with a very impressive view of the volcanos Pacaya, Fuego  and Agua. The amenities are great like the pool, bar, gym and restaurant."
50,The view from the 10th floor was great and the security of needing my room key to access my floor from the elevator made me feel safe.  The staff were courteous and prompt and the breakfast was excellent.
40,"Located near the airport, in a safe area because of the many hotels and restaurants focused on foreign tourists. The hotel is very big, with some restaurants on the grounds (the sports bar was only ok), shops, and even an small outdoor swimming pool.  Getting a lift required a bit of patience in one of the towers, as there was only one  available (the other one was reserved for employees). Rooms were good size and quiet. Buffet breakfast was also good, with a nice open area, and employees attentive. Maybe 4* would suit it better, although it was a good option"
50,"I have been to Guatemala 20 times since 1987. Barcelo is my hotel I go to the night before I am leaving. Hotel multiple restaurants,  nice rooms free WIFI and Shuttle to the airport is like 15 mins. I travel with a lot of gear and they are very accommodating."
40,"Needed a good hotel in close proximity to Guatemala Airport and this fit the bill. The hotel was very nice and very clean. Large spacious lobby and really friendly service. The rooms were large and very comfortable and well appointed. The bathroom was old, and tired, however, and the tub / shower unit looked ancient. I tried and tried but could find no way to get the tub drain open and had to leave the tub full of water. Had a late dinner in the hotel. Took a very long time to get anyone to recognize us, but once we found a waiter he took good care of us and the food was very good. The ceviche was excellent and so was the steak. The breakfast buffet was very large and had many nice options. Aside from the bathroom, it was a very nice hotel and a very nice stay."
50,"After a few weeks in Quetzaltenango, this hotel was a dream. The look and feel is classy and rich but very affordable. The next morning buffet was plentiful. My only very small criticism is that the beds are hard, well mine was anyway."
50,While on vacation with Gate1 tours we stayed at this hotel.  The location near the airport was good. We could walk to many restaurants in the area and all of our extra tour had now problem picking us up at the hotel. Uber also had no problem getting in and out. The Buffet breakfast was very good as well.
50,Stayed for 1 night due to close locality to airport. The service was excellent - all staff were friendly and accommodating. Good sized room - clean and comfortable. We were given access to the lounge whilst waiting for our room which was that extra small touch that was appreciated after a long shuttle bus ride from Lake Atitlan. Chose Japanese restaurant that evening - on the higher level of cost but food and service was good.
20,I stayed at this hotel with my Maya in-laws while I took care of business at the U.S. Embassy.  The way my in-laws were treated was despicable.  I will not return to an establishment that is so blatantly racist.
40,"The hotel has a beautiful contemporary court yard and a live pianist in the lobby. There are 3 restaurants and we ate at 2. The buffet had a good tasty selections, while the other offered live entertainment.  The hotel provides free transportation to the airport and they are in walking distance to many shops and eateries. It was  a delight to be offered large umbrellas for walking in the city when it rained"
40,"Always like staying at the Barcelo. Very nice hotel. Great staff.  Great location.Had a little trouble with the internet this time, usually not.We will stay there again with pleasure. Always recommend this place."
50,"My 2nd stay this year in Barcelo and again an excellent experience.  Stayed this time for 5 nights in total. Service at reception is great. Had a really nice room on the 10th floor with view on the volcano and nice balcony where you can sit outside in the afternoon.  Rooms have all amenities. Only point of improvement would be to upgrade the shower / bath area. This is getting outdated.  Hotel has a nice pool and also a gym. Upgrading the gym with new equipment would also be a good point for the future. Lot of business travellers and then a good gym is a PRE. Current equipment is good enough though.  Service from all personnel from lobby to bar to restaurant and room service is excellent. Quality of the food at the breakfast, lunch and room service is great. Everyone goes out of"
50,This hotel is comfortable and inviting. Staff are helpful and timely. Breakfast is an international style buffet with clear labels for each item and a large variety of cooked items and continental-style items.
50,"I stay in these hotel because my son suggested it five year a go. And I have been staying in it since then. I Recommend these Hotel to whomever likes to sleep well at night. I find the rooms clean, beds well made. "
50,"The Barcelo in Guatemala City is outstanding, it is a great looking hotel and rooms are super clean and comfortable. Nice amenities in the bathroom, a fantastic shower too. I would highly recommend the Barcelo to anyone. A very comfortable stay."
50,"I have stayed at this hotel previously (10 years before) and was pleased with it, therefore I booked it again.  I was not disappointed. It was clean, and what I would consider classy. The rooms were great, the staff was friendly, the service was good and the only complaint I have is that upon eating a tamal during breakfast, I found a piece of broken glass in my tamal.  As if this wasn't bad enough, my son who was also eating a tamal, also found a piece of broken glass in his tamal.  I would just caution people who eat at their restaurant to check and inspect their food very well. "
50,Excellent service friendly professional  clean excellent coffe bar beautiful swimming pool very security house keeping exellent water in shower exellent food good the service at the lobby bar exellent  good coffe the rom very clean
50,"The Barcelo Hotel is an excellent choice for visiting Guatemala City. It has an airport shuttle that you have to call for. It is located near the Metro express bus line to the historic district and Agenda Sexta. The rooms are nice and it has a great pool and a good fitness room. You can see at least one volcano from your room. The staff is helpful. The breakfast buffet is great and you can eat inside or on the patio by the pool. There is a Japanese restaurant and a sports bar in addition to the standard restaurant. There is a jewelry store and a handy gift shop with necessities. For sure, I am going back next time."
50,I stayed here for a night at the end of a long trip and it was a wonderful place to rest up. Breakfast was really good and the pool as well. The free airport shuttle took a load off since we were new to the city and weren’t sure the best transport to organise. The staff were helpful.
50,"Only bad is that the airport shuttle only runs until 11 p.m. so after 11 p.m. you have to find a taxi and negotiate a price. The hotel is clean, friendly staff and I recommend it but maybe if everyone complains about the shuttle not being available they will change that. "
20,"Aweful experience with food and drink s and shuttle. What you charge for food and for the quality it was highway robbery!  No one seem to take ownership of issues,they kept passin the bucks  and I want to make sure my credits went through."
50,"Very close to the airport in a safe block.  Service is great, everyone is super polite and helpful.  The pool is fairly big so even when there are a lot of people its not too crowded.  Breakfast has a lot of good options.  Very comfortable beds.  Nothing wring with this hotel and the service."
50,We travel to Guatemala 2 times per year with volunteer groups of 15-30 people from Guatemala Children’s Project and the Barcelo has always been our go to hotel for our final night. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms are alway clean and ready. Never been disappointed. 
50,Convenient location and excellent value for the price.  Extensive breakfast buffet.  Staff are friendly and plenty of onsite parking.  Nice outdoor pool and gym.  I would stay again on future trips to Guatemala City.
50,"I got in late after an evening flight,and it was incredibly comfortable and a great spot to stay until the next morning. I wished I had more time to stay in the great bed! Perfect, being close to the airport and including breakfast (perfect before traveling)"
50,We brought 3 groups through this hotel.  The staff handled us well.  Checkin was quick and they had all the keys labeled and ready to go.  They allowed us to store our bags and after we arrived early.  The shuttle was great for our airport run.
50,"I have been staying in the Barcelo hotel in Guatemala for the past 3 years. Love ve it. Price excelent, staff and amenities top notch. I will highly recommend it. Food at theirs restaurant is good and room service outstanding. "
40,"First time in Guatemala for business. Hotel was great and the same goes for the food. There's lots of different restaurants and it also has a bar/lounge across the street that does zacapa tastings. The only downside from the hotel is that it's a bit outdated, however it's maintained very well."
50,"1. It's close to the airport. The complimentary shuttle will pick you up or drop you off or you can pay $10 for a taxi. Usually 15 min away. Up to 30 in heavy traffic.  2. It's in a safe neighborhood. You can walk around the area even at night. All the best hotels are in the same area but most are priced much higher. Restaurants, shops and a grocery store are nearby.  3. The staff is bilingual and friendly. If you speak little Spanish or none at all, you'll find most of the staff can help you.  4. The rooms are nice and the facilities are great. Beautiful pool. Great shops (both a jade store and a very good handcraft store). Nice lobby.  5. The restaurants are great. Don't miss the breakfast buffet! Dinner is also great at the restaurant. And the sports bar can be noisy but"
40,"I have stayed here thrice and was the only option i would select whenever i go to Guatemala City until recently i found Hyatt which will be my home from now on whenever i go to Guatemala City. I have had no problem with Barcelo, its perfect location near from airport, free shuttle to airport, breakfast is always good, pool is perfect after long days of work. As i never had problem with his hotel thats the reason i have stayed there for 3 consecutive time during my visit. Room viewing volcano is a charm though they are old. Room facing pool are new the the view is okayish."
50,We have stayed at this hotel many times. We are always treated very well at the Barceló Guatemala City hotel.  The staff is great and the buffet breakfast is always wonderful.  You can't go wrong with this hotel.
50,I really enjoyed my night at this hotel. It’s is clean the staff is friendly and helpful. I would recommend anyone to stay here. Hey had live music at the restaurant which was very entertaining as well!
40,"Former Marriott Hotel, the food was good, the room was nice but the bed was a little hard. I will be staying here again the next time I am in Guatemala. It is in one of the better areas of the city and we walked around after dark for dinner and didn’t feel at all uncomfortable. "
40,Front desk friendly and helpful.  Early checkins  not a problem .  Room spacious and very comfortable . wifi works well tv too  Minibar but no key .. not sure why. Breakfast fine  Uber gets you to everywhere for just a couple of dollars . Good choice.
40,This is the 3rd time i’ve Stay there. Service is always good and food as well. Breakfast buffet may be chaotic some times- the hostes one day did not allow my nephew to come in with a no sleeves shirt. Kind of weird.  I tried the suites this time. They are nice but no balcony overlooking the volcanos. I will come back .
50,This was my first visit to Guatemala and I will highly recommend the Barcelo as an excellent hotel option for your overall comfort. Security was very noticeable . Its location was.perfect in close proximity to the business district and various restaurants 
40,I stayed here twice recently... both times the rooms were clean and well-appointed. The lobby area is nice - although bar service was a little slow. The breakfast was quite good. The pool is large and very nice although again we had difficulty getting service there. That didn't detract from the overall experience. Among North American chains I'd say the Barcelo is like a Sheraton or Marriott.  I'd stay there again.
50,Was very profesional friendly and clean.. its a slight walk to the livelier areas but overal a good choice and very affordable place to stay. I can not ask much more from them. I enjoy my stay everytime.
50,"I stayed for business at the Guatemala Barcelo, as a VIP expedia member they upgraded my room for free, with welcome drinks and a fruit platter in my room.  I loved the hotel, the bed was very comfortable, the color scheme was very relaxing. Wood accent throughout the hotel was perfect.  Breakfast spread was delectable. Various options for any palate, and for me I liked the local delicacies. Guacamole in the morning was perfect. Fruit selection was great.   Excellent service and facilities."
50,"If coming to Guatemala for a short period and need a good hotel near the airport , Barcelo is an option. It has everything one expects for a 5* hotel . Cordial Staff from the moment we enter, nice rooms with comfortable beds. The amenities is very complete but I would suggest a better Shampoo and shower gel. Breakfast with many options. "
50,all personal at the receptions as well all over the hotel were so polite and helpful. The room was clean and the bed mattress was very comfortable to sleep. The meeting room were very equipped. Management team very professional and  knowledgeable about the property as well the whole destination 
50,Very nice hotel with great service. Everything worked fine and staff was always very helpful. Also very good food. You can get a lot of different food here. The sportsbar was also very nice. The Breakfast was perfect. A lot of choices  to pick from. Security at the hotel was also very good. a lot of securitustaff at all times.
50,Love the Barcelo this time during our Make A wish trip for our child with cancer We adopted her 13 years ago and stayed during a visit to meet her before the adoption was finalized when we returned to pick her up after adoption was completed we stayed.  They have the most friendly and helpful staff also great food. We will stay again when we return. Highly recommended but I don' t have much to compare it with I don't travel so this was great for me not sure if it's to expensive for what you get but for us it has created lasting memories and that what counts. 
40,"It was a nice experience to be a guest of Barceló Guatemala, Hotel is nice, good location, staff was friendly, room was clean and well cared, my only complain is that the shower drain was not working fine and it does not drain water as fast as required. Business Center was nice as well, I hired a small meeting room for $20 per hour which helped us to conduct some meetings, Strikers sport bar was good, and their staff friendly as well."
50,"Superb high class luxurious hotel located in the heart of Guatemala City!!! Sprawling well kept grounds immaculately clean and stunning. Multiple restaurants on grounds for varied choices of dining of Japenese, Fine dining, to sports bar comfort food. Staff were incredibly knowledgable kind and accommodating. Many security personnel within sight but low key made me feel extremely safe and cared for. My wife said it was a dream come true for her to stay there as she used to pass by it as a child. Now visiting from the United States on vacation Barcelo was an amazing choice. Our rooms spacious Balcony for relaxing morning noon and night views with coffee or room service delivered, comfortable huge king bed, and spotlessly clean room made us very comfortable relaxed and happy."
20,Great place if you are only looking for a good night sleep in a spacious and clean room. Very convinient with a United Airlines Office on site and shuttle to the airport at 4.am. Total lack of personal service. 
50,"This is an old historic building which they have kept with the confort and details since it was opened with its original name. I always have a good experience at this place. Very seldom I required room service but, this time it was a bizarre experience. They are just not prepare to keep quality and timing. "
20,The staff are incredibly cold and non-welcoming.  We've stayed at this hotel before and experienced this but really wanted to give it another try before posting our opinion.  It's a gorgeous hotel.  It's just too bad that the staff and security detail are unwelcoming and unwilling to help you.
50,"What category room I take depends on what day of the week and the rate structure.  I really like the two story suites on the top floor of the newest building.  The hotel is close to the airport and close to many places in town.  It is a longer walk to some of my favorite hangouts, but it is still a nice property. The airport shuttle is efficient. The staff is very nice. It is an overall functional hotel."
50,"as soon as i stepped out of the taxi, i noticed that Barcelo had Plenty of security guards, i felt VERY safe, check in time was at 3 pm, yet they let me check in for FREE at 1 pm. The breakfast was ridiculously DELICIOUS, everyone was sooo professional, the pool was cold, but the hot tub was nice and hot, did i mention the buffet breakfast was delicious?? and they change money at the reception, a GREAT price for the excellent service"
50,Great location. Service at restaurant is adequate. Cleanliness is phenomenal.Sport bar is great. Personnel do their best to provide customer with a good experience regarding the time spent on site.Have their onsite convenience stores and conference rooms for business approach. 
50,"Excellent service, everything that was not immediately supplied to me. Most importantly the hotel is comfortable, cozy, affords a relaxed atmosphere, gives a sense of security, the room is always clean and well equipped, and a wide range of flavors at breakfast. In short, staying at the hotel is highly recommended.  Thanks"
50,Was a beautiful hotel would recommend it. Staff was amazing and has 3 excellent restaurants. We would love too stay there again if ever in Guatemala. Had an awesome trip too this beautiful country also. 
50,"Beautifully elegant surroundings with superior,  friendly service,  delicious dining,  and multiple gift shops.  Our stay included breakfast which featured local and continental dishes as well as an omelet station.  Wi-Fi worked well,  both rooms we stayed in had balconies,  and the linens were quality. Located near shops and restaurants. "
50,"The Barcelo Guatamala City Hotel is very centrally located. It only took a few minutes by taxi to go to the hotel. This facility is well furnished but a bit dated. The room, however was very clean and the bed very comfortable. Their staff was very friendly especially the manager on duty. He was very attentive and rightfully protective of us. You see, we had noticed there were a Big MC and a Panda Express nearby. We wanted to go there for a quick bite.  Their manager advised us not to walk through the dimly lit parking lot late in the evening. He even offered to call a cab for us. That is what I call service. Next morning, we had a very satisfying breakfast in the hotel. They had excellent selection of both local and Western cuisine plus a vast choice of fresh fruits, including a"
50,"from my last visit in May 2017 to this stay in May 2018 your service has improved. I could get a better price through one of the agencies like expedia, but dealing directly with you made a big difference. Thank you"
40,Stayed here recently while I was in the city for business. Have stayed here before and this was a good stay.  This stay was also good. Service at check-in is good and they could also facilitate late checkout.  Rooms are well equipped. Hotel has small gym area and also a pool / jacuzzi. On-site several stores are also present.  Restaurant offers buffet style breakfast and lunches. Good quality!  Wifi is free and of good quality.  It was a good stay and I will surely be back!
20,"Hotel is the old Marriott and kept the Marriott brand carpets and furnishings. Staff friendly and helpful and room was clean and maintained well.  Unfortunately hotel is seriously let down by a terrible shuttle service. It's located at the end of the airport runway about 5 minutes away and yet it took over 1 hour to get transportation. I flagged down one bus that had space but was told to wait for another. I found the other shuttle bus, whos driver said to wait inside the airport. He proceeded to pick up a private group and disappeared.   The day before leaving the hotel I confirmed with the desk that the hotel would have shuttle service and confirmed the time.  Unfortunately there was no room and instead the hotel provided a filthy taxi.   Considering it being primarily an"
50,"Everything about this hotel is good. We stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay. When we checked in, we left a bag outside the door and were in panic when we realized we were missing it in the morning. The hotel security found it and returned it to us with everything intact. Needless to say the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms we had on both occasions were nice and spacious. You will find quite a few restaurants very close to the hotel for lunch or dinner. It's proximity to the airport is a big plus."
50,"Hotel great for being close to the airport. Shuttle goes to the airport every hour on the hour. Clean, classy, comfortable has many options to eat at the hotel or a McDonalds and such nearby. I had a big room with a king sized bed, luxury. "
50,"Barcelo hotel is perfect place to stay in Guatemalacity.  We stay for 4 nights before our trip to Tikal. We made one day trips to volcano and Antigua.  Nice, clean and friendly place. Excellent shuttle service to airport! "
50,"I have traveled to more than 60 countries for my job, and this may be my favorite hotel on the planet. The facility is clean, the staff is friendly, the wifi works great and the affordable rate includes dinner AND breakfast buffets, both of which are excellent. The hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the Guatemala City airport. When I arrived for my most recent stay, the van driver said he wasn't expected me and that he had a full load scheduled already. Then he asked me to excuse him for a minute and, when he returned, he said he would put me in a cab to the hotel at no charge. He waited with me for the cab (which was the CLEANEST cab I've ever been in, btw.) and helped load my bags. Class act, all the way around! "
50,"The  Hotel  Barcelo  of  Guatemala  City  is  one  of  the  best  Hotel  in  the  city.  Very  good  service,  the  room  was  perfect,  the buffet was  delicious  and  a  lot  of  variety.  It  was  one  of  my  best  experience  ever."
50,"Normally in Guatemala i look for nice hotels. Slept in many different ones. However Barcelo is my favorite, no drama, all possible, friendly staff and clean. I was upograded as i travel a lot. Thank you. "
50,Barceló Guatemala is a beautiful hotel.  The gym is not very nice because the equipment either doesn´t work or it´s very old. The food at the restaurants is excellent.  The staff is very friendly and the rooms are clean.  It´s a good option!
40,"A very nice place to stay for a couple nights.  Very nice rooms, large and comfortable with lots of hot water for showers and hair wash.  If you're used to pillow top mattress you will be disappointed there.  Room safe and room bar (for a price), big screen TV with several English channels. Nice restaurants and great buffet breakfast.  If you're into sports bars and your idea of dining out is bar snacks, that 's available too.   Beautiful lobby and lovely artwork through out the hotel.  There's a lovely courtyard if you're looking for a few moments of peace. The reception desk is very helpful, from currency exchange to lost luggage.  They can handle US currency, Guatemalan and probably Honduran as well, even though I didn't try.  There are a couple ATMs off to the side of the"
20,I had never stayed at this hotel even though I have made well over 20 trips to Guatemala so I was anxious to see. How this hotel was.  The outside of the hotel was attractive but the rooms were very dated. The tile in the bathroom and tub was plenty scratched and the tub did NOT drain so I had to shove the soap dish in the area to get it to drain. Breakfast was good but value for your money was overpriced. Would not choose to stay there again after many problems just getting checked in.  Thanks but NO THANKS!!   
50,"We stay at this hotel for 26 hours. The lobby is beautiful, staff is very friendly. Rooms are large and beds are extremely comfortable. In the hotel lobby are a couple of pretty good restaurants. There is a sports bar called Strikes.I believe it was a Champions before. Also within walking distance are some very good restaurants. "
50,Hotel is very close to the airport and other amenities. The staff is very courteous and the facilities are very maintained. Rooms are very clean. The breakfast buffet has many choices and is included with room price.  
50,"A great hotel.  Very beautiful hotel with beautiful grounds and a beautiful lobby.  The front desk is excellent and very helpful. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfortable.  The Business Center is very nice and the young gentleman working there was very helpful.   There is a McDonald's next door and a small grocery store across from the gym. The airport shuttle was excellent. The breakfast was great.  I have stayed at hotels all over the world, and no breakfast compared to this one.  It was magnificent"
40,"My wife and I stayed here in February at the beginning and end of a Guatemala group tour (Caravan). The accommodations were very comfortable, the staff always helpful. We enjoyed drinks and meals at Strikers, the in-house sports bar,and drinks and people-watching at the hotel lobby bar. The location was great for a Sunday morning walk into the center of activity on Avenida de la Reforma, closed to traffic on Sunday mornings with walkers, joggers, skateboarders, bikers, and a beautiful sunny day. As part of the tour package, we enjoyed buffet dining in the hotel restaurant - good, if not great, varied, plentiful."
30,"a fairly tired large chain hotel, circa 1990 decor, with many tour groups and business meetings.  but a fair buffet dinner, breakfast and nice pool.  US-grade power showers. (like most places in guatemala) good handicraft giftshops.  near airport."
40,Nice hotel with 3 restaurants. The buffet restaurant is very good. They had many healthy options for each meal. The fruit is exceptional . Rooms are normal size but very soundproof . Bathroom is small but functional.room has a minibar but you must ask for the key when you check in. Nice pool. Also walking distance to a little supermarket whick made it very convenient.
40,"The sort of place to start or end your trip with a night's stay if you want something a little nicer but not absolute top end. Especially if you crave a fix of American sports the sports bar will fulfil your needs. Food is average here but the screens are great. Nothing to complain about, a perfectly decent stopover."
50,I found this hotel very comfortable and perfect for work.  Good internet. Good food.  I particularly liked room service. their tropic plates were very tasty.  Guatemalan coffee in the room was excellent.  Piano player when I returned from work was a pleasure.  Very close to the airport.  Made it easy to transfer.
30,"Safe large hotel.  I booked a room for 3 adults (all family members).  When I arrived to check in, they told me that only 2 adults could stay in the room for the booked price and that I would have to pay extra for my daughter to stay in our room.  I would have switched hotels but did not want to deal with taxi/travel to another.  The pizza in Strikers has no flavor, very generic crust.  The hotel room/beds were very comfortable.  Very close to the airport - we took the hotel shuttle which worked well for us, be aware that this only leaves every 1 hour and this is a large hotel so many people were waiting for the 5am shuttle - we were very early so were able to get on without issue.  We only stayed 1 night before our flight out."
30,"This was one of the stops on our long trip through Centra America, the visit was an experience, nothing special in this country just regular things to see really nothing wowing us, I'll try to post some pics "
50,Great location in the center of La Zona Viva. Beautiful pool. Comfortable and clean rooms with great service. Free shuttle to the airport. It's a great landing or take off spot when coming or going from Guatemala. We'll be back!
50,"excellent stay - lovely room and great breakfast.  I enjoyed my stay very much.  the room was comfortable, great location with a lovely breakfast buffet in the morning.  I have stayed many times and will be happy to come back."
50,"The hotel has great facilities, it offers a well diverse combination of leisure and business. It will be great if the upgrade a little bit the rooms but overall anything you need in a hotel of this category.  Definitely good choice if you are looking to be in Guatemala anytime soon"
40,"After a long drive in from Montericco the Hotel was a welcome oasis. The room was well appointed. Clean. and inviting. We went to the Japanese restaurant for dinner and we were well served, good place to rest up between adventures"
50,This is the best place to stay near the airport. Their shuttle service is prompt to and from the Airport. The morning breakfast buffet included in the price is very good. The other amenities look very nice but I've been totoo busy  use them.
50,"This was a great enjoyable and fun trip. I would recommend the trip to all of my friends and family. Oscar, our tour director made the trip interesting and fun with his cheerful enthusiasm and knowledge."
40,Our stay here was only an overnight one with a very early start at 4.30 am but the service and staff was faultless and they provided is with a excellent packed breakfast to eat at the airport. The hotel is huge and very modern and could be anywhere in the worlds did not have much local character.
20,"I was extremely disappointed by this hotel. I had a two night stay that I cut short to move to another hotel. At the aiport, the shuttle service was bad. No customer service, no on-time pickup, and the driver wanted to wait 15 minutes for other passengers, even though we were 3 and the drive to the hotel is 6 minutes only. The hotel rooms are in desperate need of refurbishing. The beds and furniture looks very old.  The bathroom has a tub/shower combo, but the grout and caulking used in the shower was gross. The beds were rock-hard, very uncomfortable. And the last draw was the Internet. Although free, it was completely unusable. Nothing loaded, no email, nothing. A call to the reception explained that since most people use the internet at night, the internet would be slow."
50,"Clean room, great location, close to the airport and downtown. Had a great view from the room and got to see the city fireworks during New Years! The hotel employees were efficient, helpful and welcoming."
50,"This is our 3rd stay at the Barcelo.  Reason we continue to select this hotel is because it is close to the airport, breakfast buffet has a good variety of choices, including omelettes or eggs the way you select and the dinner buffet is also not bad (it can be pricey, but if you are tired and do not want to go out, it is a good choice).  The rooms are okay, they are getting dated, but are clean.  The beds in our opinion are comfortable.  We have no issues sleeping.  The bathrooms are also clean.  There are 2 towers in the hotel.  I believe, the newer tower does not have any balconies and the bathrooms are bigger.  But, if you are going to be in the hotel during the day, we would recommend the tower with the balconies.  The bathroom's are smaller in this tower, but we just like"
50,"We stayed for two weeks at this hotel and only recommend it; the beds were some of the best I've had anywhere, great bedding and towels. The service was optimal and very friendly. But the greatest part was the breakfast buffet, there were so many choices, great variety of fruit, local dishes and international dishes. Super friendly the staff, only drawback the bread was not up to par; almost brought my own bread, there is a wonderful bakery San Martin no too far away.  The hotel is located near Avenida Reforma and if one has a car it is much easier to get out of the parking in contrast too the other hotels in the area. It is an easy spot from where to make trips, and parking is more than ample. Although the bar, which one finds in the lobby, with very comfortable chairs, and"
40,"First - When I first walked in the first thing I noticed was the piano player and thought ""this place is too fancy for us"". The lobby/main floor is pristine. The staff at the front desk was patient when I had a trouble following Spanish. Second - I'm sure this is a common feature but I was baffled at first when I kept pressing my floor number in the elevator and nothing happened. Someone put his room key in and did it for me. Ah I see. Third - we go into our room and are baffled again when we can't turn some lights on and find out we have to use our room key in order to do so. Huh? Ok. Anyway, the room itself was mostly good. When I closed the curtains I found some pretty gross stains. But at least the bed and the bathroom was clean! They supply a lot of toiletries: shoe shine"
50,"I’ve been to this hotel many times & have never been disappointed. The staff are wonderful & the rooms are very comfortable. I especially love the beds & look forward to sleeping in them. The sheets are always clean here! The beds are very firm, which I personally enjoy as my back has issues. I always wake up feeling great since a soft bed can send me to the chiropractor!! There are many amenities in the bathroom that I enjoy as well. There is a mini coffee pot & also mini fridge. Sometimes I’ve had double balconies, but usually just one. It’s nice to have coffee & enjoy the Mountain View. The Wi-Fi also works great here! The pool area is very clean & beautiful. There’s also a hot tub & pool bar. Nice little shops & restaurants in hotel. You will definitely enjoy you’re stay"
50,"The hotel has very convenient under roof car parking and is walking distance to other hotels and restaurants.  The rooms are clean and well equipped with A/C, clothes iron, hair dryer, robes, etc. I highly recommend the buffet breakfast option!"
50,"In this hotel I celebrated my birthday party when I was fifteen years old, we chose this hotel because is one of the best in Guatemala, it has a really good infraestructure and they have good service and we could afford it. That night a had a really fun time with my friends and family. We dance a lot and the food that they gave us was delicious, especially, the desserts but the issue was that the party started too late. The next day i went to the pool with my family, it was a great experience because I had the opportunity to share with my family and then we had to return to my house. I highly recommend this hotel."
50,"We held a one day business conference and I spent three nights in the hotel.  The staff did an excellent job with everything relating to the conference, the set up, the meals--all was handled as smoothly as any hotel anywhere--a fine job.  As for the room, my room was clean, comfortable and with a nice view of the volcanoes!  I used the breakfast buffet and it was good with attentive service.  Everyone from the staff that I interacted with was very friendly and professional.  Only one suggestion:  I found the room to be warm and a little stuffy with the air conditioning on low, but it was too loud to sleep if I turned it up.  It may not bother others--I tend to have the same complaint about many hotels.  "
50,We stayed a few nigth at the Barcelo. It is well situated in a secure part of the city and walk-able distance from shopping boutiques including a huge modern mall. Food was excellent both a la carte and ample buffet. Rooms are nice clean and some have a view on the surrounding volcanos.
50,A truly nice hotel in the Zona Viva area. It's very close to great restaurants and shopping areas and its proximity to the airport makes it a wonderful place to stay. Not my first visit and will certainly not be my last!
50,"If you travelling to Guatemala, check the price of this hotel, prices changes very much, the advantage is that this hotel has several restaurants and you dont have to go out to have dinner.  Locared no la zona viva of Guatemala and near the airport "
50,"We stayed here twice when it was a Marriott.  It is as nice now as it was then.  Our room was a suite with two levels.  The lower portion was the living area, with the beds on the upper level.  The room rate included the delicious buffet breakfast and access to the club level lounge.  In the lounge we were able to get hors d'oeuvres and drinks.  Breakfast was also available there in the morning.  The pool area was very nice with a heated pool and large hot tub.  The staff at the front desk and in the club lounge were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is within an easy walk of the Zona Viva, which has many great restaurants and great shopping.  Our room also included our transfer to the very nearby La Aurora Airport (GUA).  We would definitely stay here again."
50,"Stayed for one night just before an earlier international departure. The hotel is very near the airport and the shuttle made it easy to get there. Even though it was a short stay, I was impressed with the hotel. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless internet connection was easy and high speed. Room services for dinner was also very good. The Japanese-themed meal was delicious and service was prompt.  "
50,"Stayed for two nights. Enjoyed the pools, the saunas, the good breakfast, and the good service. The location actually is very close to the airport and it some times an advantage if you are not intending to visit the city."
40,"A great hotel in the city with complimentary parking. Rooms are nice with comfortable beds. A breakfast buffet is offered each morning with great options to choose from. I would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in the city,"
40,"A comfortable place to stay, close to the airport, friendly staff.  I left an external hard drive with important (to me) things stored on it.  The room cleaner found it and turned it in to the office who held it for me to pick up."
40,"We spent two nights at this hotel, at the beginning and the end of a Caravan Tour of Guatemala. The hotel was close to the airport which was very convenient. The hotel is well maintained and the rooms were comfortable and clean. The ice machine on each floor was great. Meals were included in our rate and were buffet style. The breakfast offering was extensive. The dinner offering was okay for a buffet but we would have preferred an a la carte option."
50,"We stayed for 3 nights. We were given a lovely, spacious room with 2 balconies. We could even see one of the volcanos from one of the balconies. The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was on the firm side which we prefer. The linens were fresh and had a nice scent - no bleach smell. Room was quiet and we never heard any of the neighbors. Breakfast was included in our rate and there was an incredible selection of breakfast items including fresh fruit, pastries, American and Guatemalan dishes. There were chefs available to cook eggs to order. We also enjoyed the cafe con leche. We found this hotel offered a high level of service. The staff throughout the hotel were always friendly, polite and helpful. The airport was just a quick 15-20 minute drive away."
40,"We stayed at the Barcelo for 2 nights at the start of our holiday and 1 night at the end.  We enjoyed the room, the ice machine, the pool and the spa immensely.   The lifeguard Eddie was a treat to speak with and always ready with a smile.  The massage at the spa was relaxing and well done.  Our only complaint would be the blase food served at the buffet in the main restaurant, La Vista.  Breakfast was generally ok with fruit, pancakes and some rolls etc.  Dinner served much of the same each night and most of the food was just ok.    All in all we enjoyed our stay at the Barcelo!"
40,"My husband and I stayed here two nights. The first night of our 11-day tour of Guatemala and the last night of our tour. This hotel is great as a starting off point or ending point of your trip to Guatemala because of it's close proximity to the airport. However, there is not a lot of things to do within walking distance of the hotel so I cannot imagine spending more than one night here.  Both times we arrived after check-in time but we had to wait about 20 to 30 minutes because our room was not ready.  Not a big deal, but not sure why this happened so late in the day.  Our rooms were both identical.  Spacious and clean and the beds were comfortable. The one difference was that the hairdryer in our first room was a regular, modern hairdryer that worked fine.  The hairdryer in"
40,"This is quite a very well run business hotel, spacious, good decor, all amenities and with courteous staff. The breakfast buffet is well stocked and have a great variety of hot and cold items. The hotel is located only 15 minutes from the Airport (when in perfect traffic condition), and there is hourly free shuttle service.  The area seems to be safe enough to walk at night (though not much to see after hours).  5 minutes walk to the nearest Transmetro station (very low cost express bus with its own dedicated bus lane) direct to the downtown area. The only inconvenience is the bath tub glass door keeps on leaking water to the washroom floor."
50,"I spent four nights there.  The room was quite large.very nice, lots of room and the toiletries were very nice.  Security was very good and it was present every where.  The pool area was amazing it was across from the patio and dining area.  You could watch swimmers while eating..  I had access to the VIP floor and the refreshments were very nice. Others in my group had 2 level suites that were very nice also with VIP access.  Had the buffet breakfast every day and it was excellent.  Something for everybody to fill up on.  I especially enjoyed the fresh juices.  I enjoyed shopping in the hotel shops which were pretty neat.  Some of the same items that was at the Market for about the same price. The shuttle service was very good however I thought the traffic was really bad, lots"
30,"Currently staying at number 1030, we have had issues with the neighbor throwing a party, listening to loud music and yelling.  The reception were so unkind to ask us to move to another room, instead of solving the issue with bad behaving guests.. That's pretty poor, when you pay alot to get a good night's sleep. Otherwise the hotel is OK."
40,Location is great for airport flights.  Allows for a short transfer and minimal traffic.  Good size rooms and nice beds.  Didn’t try either of the hotels restaurants and wish we had.  Instead ate at the sports bat and the food was average.
50,"We spent 3 nights at the Barcelo in Guatemala City, which was convenient to the airport.  It was nice lodging, with good security for people using the elevators.  Room keys were required to select any floor in the elevator, except the ground floor.  We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, and also had the buffet dinner at the motel restaurant.  The rooms were spacious and up to date.  Our room had a nice balcony.  Nice toiletries were included in the bathrooms.  A shuttle was available from the airport.  There was a grocery store within walking distance.  We would definitely stay here again if in Guatemala City."
50,"Great breakfast, clean comfortable rooms, airport shuttle service, excellent service by friendly staff. Fantastic value for price paid. Barcelo loyalty program gives discounts and upgrades adding value to your stay there. I highly recommend."
50,"Stayed 3 nights here while on a tour. The hotel was immaculate. Great facilities including a beautiful pool, hot tub and plenty of good restaurants within the hotel. With my package, it included a full breakfast including an omelet station, fresh fruits, breads, etc. Something for everyone. Since it is not safe to walk outside the hotel at night, it was nice to have everything within the complex. We watched the Super Bowl at the sports bar. This restaurant was very much like an American pub. Great casual food at a reasonable price. The front desk employees were AMAZING! They would have packaged breakfasts if you have an early morning tour/departure (if you request one the night before). They were always available to answer questions and they were always friendly. I ordered room"
40,"No free breakfast when purchasing nights thru Hotels.com. Decent location, a little noisy from aircraft. Clean, guarded property. Nice pool and facilities. Courtesy shuttle service to local airport (Guat)."
50,Very pleased with room 808. Two queen beds. Wonderful view of the volcano. Quiet when sliding door is closed. Good a/c. Coffee maker in room. Mini bar.   Very secure property. Piano bar. Good Japanese restaurant. Nice gym. Sports bar. Pool. Sauna. Jacuzzi.   Clean. Well maintained. Can’t ask for more. 
40,The Barcelo was perfect for what we needed. We needed something close to the airport and that it was (five minutes). The Barcelo hotel shuttle was waiting for us at the airport and was prompt in the morning for the 5am transport.  Having a free shuttle was fabulous.  The hotel room was nice.  The beds are most definitely not queen size.  Our reservation was for 2 people even though we had 4 which would easily fit in the room. They wanted to charge us for two more people but we persisted and were not charged. The desk guy laughed (outloud) at us when we said all four were staying in the room.  The room was great and had a blowdryer! Always a bonus when you're traveling and have bad travel hair.
40,We stayed at Barcelo for one night. We landed at the airport around 10:30 PM and wanted a place to stay overnight as we had to catch our early morning flight to Tikal. We read a lot about safety at the airport and Guatemala city in general and wanted to stay at a secured place. We must admit our trip went very peacefully and this hotel very well lived upto their standards. They have complimentary shuttles from 4 AM to 11 PM. This was kind of nice and we were quiet happy and relaxed to see someone holding placards with our names on our arrival at the airport. We booked this hotel at very last minute. Only few hours before reaching Guatemala city and were pleased to see they had shuttle arranged for us. The hotel rooms were also big and comfortable. Overall a great place to stay.
40,A great place to stay in Guatemala City. Friendly and helpful staff.Great buffets. nice pool. The room along the main road was a little noisy. Both rooms we stayed in had problems with the toilet. One constantly topped up the water and the other one flushed poorly.
50,"If you are looking for a place to stay close to the airport, this is the place. Super convenient and great service. I stayed and other hotels in the city, but this one was a great success for me. Rooms are very clean."
40,Very good hotel.  Have stayed before several times.   Hotel is older but still very good.  Excellent staff.  Shuttle runs ONLY on the hour.   Should run more often.  Great breakfast buffet.      Very happy with my stay.
40,Shuttle service to and from airport was fast. 5 minutes to Aurora intl airport. Rooms were clean. breakfast buffet was included. Staff were very friendly and helpful. It was right after Christmas and the tree in the lobby was very beautiful. 
30,"For the Christmas holiday, it was nicely decorated but the poor customer service, unfriendly staff made the visit a less than merry stay.  The room was nice but lacked certain amenities one would expect of a 4 star rating.  Most pointedly, the window/room could not get totally dark.  The curtains covered only the edge of the windows (I believe a deliberate design) and lights and sunshine could stream in.  The wifi connection was strong but limited to one account access/person.  I could not use two electronics connected to the wifi at the same time.  The toiletries was also lacking in lotion but was generous with other amenities.  The entrance is a little difficult to find but parking was free until check out (a nice plus).  Located within walking distance of the hotel were"
50,"Lovely room with a comfy bed and a view overlooking the swimming pool. The breakfast was great and we especially enjoyed the coffee. Unfortunately we miss understood the shuttle to the airport was only once in an hour, but that’s the only inconvenience. "
40,"America stile hotel with American prices for food and drinks which was high for the area.  TV only had a couple of channels in English, but didn't spend a lot of time in room.  Pool bar was great for hanging with friends."
50,"Our group was coming in late at night to carry our a project to build and equip a two-room primary school for a rural village.  We were loaded with 18 heavy suitcases of school supplies, books and tools plus 12 smaller personal pieces for the 6 team-members arriving.  I had asked the Barceló Guatemala City agent for help in getting baggage and people to the hotel.  When we came out of the terminal we were happy (and much relieved) to find a bus and driver waiting just for our group."
40,Stayed here 3 nights on a Caravan Tour.  Very pleasant big hotel.  Rooms and restaurant typical of the genre. Ten dollar taxi ride to centre of town but there's not much there to see. Don't understand some of the criticism of wifi or food.  We found both pretty typical of Latin America.
40,"Overall, my experience during my stay was very good. The hotel is close to the airport and good shopping. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Some of the rooms need some updating but overall was a good experience. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. "
50,"Arrived after 24hr flights shuttle bus from airport to hotel, driver friendly fortunately good English. Checked in quick straight to room worth joining there reward club extra worth while. Went for spilt level room it has two bathrooms, bottle water, supper big bed,free WiFi, breakfast included £5 tray charge.in country for 4 weeks thinking .I might return on departure!!"
50,"Spacious rooms, great service, good wifi, great breakfast, nice gift shops, good hot water and shower head , nice view, good amenities. Location is perfect for airport, shuttle service, good hostesses and  premium hospitality suite. No complaints."
50,"Stayed one night during our visit to Guatemala. Hotel is a little bit far to city centre however fine transportation is available. It is good for a daily business trip or a short stay in the Guatemala City. Clean , nice breakfast  and bar .There are many places to eat and walk around the area."
50,"We enjoyed Our stay at the Barcelo. It is the best deal around. The service is always top rate. We have stayed many time and are always satisfied. Whether is is their clean comfortable rooms, their top rate breakfast buffet or the pool and fitness facilities. Everything is always clean and top rate. We have stayed before and will stay there again."
50,"Very good location and seems safe to walk around. The staff is very friendly and some people do speak English.  There are many places to eat near by that you can walk to. The Pool needs a new sound system, but is beautiful. "
40,Hotel is nice and clean. Feels very safe and has Great amenities. The breakfast is one of the better for hotels in their area. Has a great pool and hot tub (warm tub) service has been good and hotel rooms are very clean and modern. 
40,"There are definitely parts of the hotel that need updating. Someone mentioned the poor design of the shower door in the bathroom that allows water to slip through causing a puddle; this is accurate.   Also there is air freshener in the elevators and in the hallways and it is a bit of an assault on the senses and gives me a headache.   That said, I love that there is a gym attached to this hotel and so it has the largest fitness center of any hotel I’ve ever stayed at! In addition to a huge cardio machine selection, the pool and hot tub are great, and there are even spin and yoga classes, squash and racquetball courts.   So, with a little bit of updating this hotel could be great. This seems to be the case with all the hotels I’ve stayed in in (3) Guatemala so far."
50,Everything was great about this hotel.  They went beyond the expected to the exceptional!  Everyone was friendly and anxious to provide excellent service.  The room was on the first floor with access to a private and public courtyard.  We listened to the music two nights and it was good.  The singer from Costa Rica was exceptional!  Overall our stay was the best on our trip!
50,"excellent hotel  good restaurants good price excellent  service in every way. very good swimming pool as well as there gim, every time i'm there i enjoy my time a lot, this hotel is excellent for any occasion,  with family by your self on a business trip "
30,"We've stayed at this property many times over the past 12 years. On our last visit, we noticed how tired and shabby the rooms are looking, they are definitely in need of a remodel. It's impossible to take a shower without getting water all over the floor due to the poor shower door design.  It's also annoying that the bathroom door is just a sliding door that doesn't stay shut. We had something dripping from the ceiling all night.  The staff is great, and there is an exceptional breakfast buffet.  The pool is nice, but it's hard to find towels in the evening. The staff puts towels out in the morning, but never refreshes the supply or cleans up the used ones that people leaving laying around.  On our return trip to the airport, our shuttle van sounded like it was about to fall"
40,"This special oportunity we spend the time for New year eve in This Comfort hotel. Like every family we enjoy the place, the pool, the restaurants, the gym, the courts and of course the room. We really like the hotel the service was nice too. Me kids love the pool. Recommended. Just the New year party could be much better. "
40,I stayed here before  flight and it was really close to the airport I was there in less than 10 minutes. Rooms were super comfy and nicely decorated. they have a great swimming pool which was nice to relax in before my flight.
50,I've stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala many times but this was the first time we opted to upgrade to the Premium Level. The rooms are located in a different wing than the standard rooms which at first I was a bit concerned about as I'd always enjoyed the views of the volcanos and balconies in the other building. But the city view  of the Torre del Reformador from our premium level room on the 8th floor  was quite spectacular especially since were were there during the holiday period and it was possible to see the fireworks at night.   I was also thrilled to discover volcano views from the Premium lounge ( on the 9th floor) The Premium lounge experience was excellent - it was never very crowded and the young woman who was the server ( sorry I forgot her name) was very attentive and
40,Two at the beginning and the last night in Guatemala.  The hotel was very close to the airport and free shuttle service...even 5:00 AM when a bunch of us left on New Year's Eve.  The room was nice...big comfy bed and much appreciated tub after a long day of sightseeing!  Only downside is the fact that it is in the business center and not walkable to any of the main tourist attractions in the Old Town area.  Room was quiet even though I was on the third floor facing the main street.  That was a surprise!
50,"This is a very nice  hotel.  It has everything that you would want in a modern hotel: clean, great service, good food, bar, free shuttle on the hour to the airport, nice pool.  We walked around the neighborhood to stretch our legs and felt perfectly safe, although there isn't much in walking distance except for the grocery store which is only a block away.   It would be great for a business trip or a short stay in Guatemala City.  You would be please to encounter a hotel like this in any major city."
30,Private drive to and from airport is convenient. Room good size with nice amenities in bathroom. Needs upkeep and refurbishing. Large breakfast buffet   Nearby convenience and liquor stores. Attached to restaurant and shops
20,"I stay here often for work but... the bed are very very hard and the WiFi is absolutely terrible!... and while checking in the front desk know that’s the internet is bad and they just say to write a review of how bad it is. It’s hard to do work using their terrible wifi and it’s been like this for two years an a half since I’ve started coming here and if you decide to go out one night and you get here a little later at night they are rude to the taxi driver and you(the security guys) the breakfast gets served much too late if you have an early flight you might only get coffee and bread, or nothing if you have a very early check in. This hotel needs a make over badly! Old wall paper hard beds yellowed toilet covers and you have to share shampoo, conditioner, body wash... ugh this"
50,"Great hotel with quality facilities, very clean spacious rooms with all amenities. Love the warm swimming pool and jacuzzi. Excellent breakfast with lots of options. The hotel is located in a safe zone with many restaurants within walking distance. But its advice to take caution at all times when going out."
40,Flying visit to Guatemala City on business and was recommended this hotel.  I was totally exhausted throughout the trip but the hotel ticked all of the boxes for making it as relaxing as possible.  A great breakfast buffet but sadly an early flight meant I missed the breakfast on the 2nd day.   I never even got to see the leisure facilities  but the bar was friendly.  
50,"Excellent service and facilities. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. The holiday decorations were unsurpassed.  The hotel is located in the center of Guatemala City, in walking distance to restaurants, supermarket, and other cultural sites...an excellent location."
20,"Me and my girlfriend were there on December 8th for one night and had a duplex superior suite with premium service. When we arrived we did not have a reservation so we just booked whatever room was available and that happened to be the most expensive one that includes premium service (all other rooms were full). However we were not told at check-in that we had premium service nor what premium service actually means. We found out afterwards that it means that all drinks in the premium lounge are included, as are sandwiches and other food all day long.. when checking out they didn't ask us about how or stay was either. Hotel and room was beautiful, but the lack of information provided about the premium service left a bitter taste in our mouths. Not sure if we'd go back again."
50,"Stayed at Barcelo after a long week of work. This place is amazing. Staff is helpful always smiling. Great amenities for everyone. My favorite place Jacuzzi... Great Resturant tried them all. Quick walk to many other restaurants, shops, bus. Overall great experience. One key point it is SAFE!!! Thank you mi Bella Guatemala! "
50,"Very nice hotel. Rooms are pretty big with a balcony overlooking the city. Bathroom is bug and well stock. Bed is comfy. To park is a little tricky: have to leave the hotel to park, and drive around like less than a block. Once in the parking, there is direct access to the hotel. The only complaint is that housekeeping was knocking at my door at 8am!!!! They dont realize that people are still sleeping/resting at that time!! Location is not the best one. It seems a safe area but Zona 10 (where are the nice hotels, restaurants, stores, night life, bars, malls are a bit far away. "
50,This Hotel was a resort. Felt like Royalty We had a 2 floor suite connected by a spiral staircase  The buffet was 5 star. The parking lot was secure and guarded 2 large screen TVs with plenty of channels. Great service
50,"I do not normally stay in luxury hotels, but decided to splurge a little on this before my flight out of Guatemala. And I am so glad I did! I had the most wonderful two nights here decompressing after a long trip throughout Guatemala, El Salvador, and Belize.  The bed was so incredibly comfortable, the bathroom was amazing, with so many amenities and constant hot water.  And the staff, especially the security staff, was so friendly and helpful. Room service was reasonably priced. And they have a FREE airport shuttle.  Amazing stay!"
50,"Upon arrival to Guatemala, I stayed at the beautiful and elegant Barceló Hotel in Guatemala City. My room was so nice that I felt like royalty. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I would love to stay at other Barceló Hotels around the world."
50,"This hotel is great year round. We're a family of seven and we travel to Guatemala once - three times a year and we always choose this hotel. It's staff, location, and services are great...it always works out for us. "
40,"Stayed here for airport proximity and a night of comfort after 1 mo in Guatemala.  Free Shuttle was on time, staff were good and the room was clean.  I'd stay again.  Got a discount via booking.com on the room"
50,"Beautiful hotel with clean, luxury beds to sleep well in Guatemala City. Quiet room, slept like a dream. Great hot shower with big towels and robes. Nice outdoor pool and poolside seating. Easy shuttle to airport.  "
50,Great first time. Lobby staff was very helpful and quick. Bell Hop was fast and experienced. Breakfast Buffet was great and lots of food. We enjoyed the Wi-Fi and seating in the relaxed lobby.  Thank you
30,"Stayed here one night while on our way to Flores/Peten. Arrived and had to wait 15 minutes while the one front desk person checked in one person. After another 15 minutes to get checked in we get our room key and enter our room which surprise was occupied and hear that they were in shower, so we quietly make our exit and go back to lobby and after another 15 minutes get another room key and after an hour we finally get to our room but at this point all 3 of us are so fed up and pissed off and all they can say is sorry. The hotel is large and pool is okay, bar was nice but not a lot of restaurants close by. Walked to a gas station and got bags of chips and soda for dinner. Glad we made an early exit the next day.  Would not stay here again, not worth the money and staff was very"
10,"I'm writing this review from my room at this very moment because of the recent change to your WiFi policy. You know how I know it was a recent change, because I was JUST here, two weeks ago! Because I am (was!) a regular customer.  I arrive tonight only to find out, when trying to connect my laptop to the wifi  that my wifi code given by the hotel only works for ONE device per room!  So, you can either have your phone, or laptop connected at once, NOT both. As I'm here for work, it's crucial I have both as I use my phone to stay connected with WhatsApp and my laptop to, you know, work.   Of COURSE I could get another one for a fee.  I've come here a lot in the last couple of years with my team for work. There are currently 4 of us here. You will no longer get our business for"
50,"We stayed in this hotel 3 different times during our visit to Guatemala. Each time we had very large, clean, comfortable bed and quite room. We enjoyed breakfast selections and the female chef prepared superb omelettes every morning. "
50,It was a wonderful stay at this hotel. I decided to stay at Guatemala Barcelo since I had already stayed at the Barcelo in San Salvador and Costa Rica. Awesome staying at these hotels. I would recommended them 110%.
40,"Close to the airport, good service, and a great breakfast. I’ve enjoyed staying here numerous times. I always feel like the rooms are a good value and a bit above average. Plus there is a McDonalds right on the corner for a quick snack. "
40,"My father and I spent one night here at the start of our trip and found it fulfilled its purpose very well. Rooms are well-appointed (some with balconies), breakfast is broad and tasty and there are a number of facilities (a few restaurants, nice pool and spa). Its location so close to the airport is great and every stay comes with a free shuttle service.  My only word of warning is that being a business hotel and convention centre, it does get extremely busy in the common areas and this will put off those looking for some modicum of peace in busy Guatemala City."
50,"The staff is always courteous, friendly and professional.  Always ready to help and answer any questions we might have.  From the pool to the breakfast buffet, a very pleasurable experience in every way!"
30,"We returned to our 3rd-floor room after dinner on a Friday night to find that there was a VERY noisy party going on on the 2nd floor--the loudest ""music"" I have ever heard. When I called the desk around 8:00 p.m., I asked, ""How long is this  music going to last?"" The person who answered said, ""what music?"" He said he would send someone to check it out. Half an hour later when the band/DJ was taking a break, someone knocked on our door and said he heard nothing. Later, around 10:00 p.m., my husband went down to the desk where there were several other irate guests. At that time, the staff admitted that there was a party going on that would probably last until 2:00 a.m. They offered us a room on the 8th floor, which we accepted, but moving in the middle of the night was not at all"
50,This was my second time staying at Barceló. I love its cleanliness and that it's conveniently located near the airport. The free shuttle was greatly appreciated. The wifi works well and is free. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms roomy.  
50,Barcelo was a great hotel to spend my night before departure. It was close and convenient to the airport and included a shuttle! Breakfast buffet was very inviting and really good.  Over all atmosphere comfortable
40,"Organize better the car circulation into the hotel for drop of in the main entrance separate the arrival of the  new guest , with others who came to visit, or stay for the events.  Overall good personalities on the employees,   "
50,Great vacation hotel. Adequate for business. Good value for your money. Food is good. Friendly staff. Very accomodative. Japanese restaurant food is excellent. Pickup at airport needs improvement. First bus is for airline personnel so you always need to wait for next bus to arrive. 
20,No upgrades since 2008. The only difference in this property since they took over from Marriott is that they renamed the sports bar in the lobby. I would like to see them reinvest in the property and make the experience better from a guest's point of view.
40,"overall is very good  however , some areas like Striker in need of more training and pick up speed. pointing the shuttle schedule to the Airport as we missed  it by a few minutes ,we thought it was every 30 minutes"
40,"We stayed just for a night in this hotel and the check in was pretty easy compared to other hotels of this category. The city view room was awesome. The balcony was filled with water from a just completed rain. The food options available in the restaurants were good. We had a bad experience, which can't be ignored by an international traveller. My colleague kept his luggage near the receptionist with her permission before he entered to have his breakfast. However when we came out the luggage was not there and the receptionist showed her ignorance. After a handful 30 minutes, it was recovered from a shuttle car stationed outside the entrance of the hotel. There was no one other than few hotel employees in the shuttle bus and thus definitely no guests took it by mistake. Now only"
10,This experience was awful. The tub was clog the 1st day we arrived and it took them more than 3 hours to fix it. We paid for a 3 bedroom room and they gave us a 2 room and when we told them they put a tiny bed on the side of the window. They left only 2 bathroom towels and I had to call everyday and ask them for a 3rd towel.  We had a barcelo rewards account and they refuse to put it on the reservation. Awful place!
40,"We stayed at the Hotel Barcelo for two nights. Our stay was pleasant. Check in was efficient and the front desk staff were accommodating to an early arrival. However, though requested, we did not get a room with a view. The double queen bed room with balcony was clean, relatively spacious and very nice. There was plenty of room for 2 or 3 suitcases. The patio doors were very streaky and whoever had tried to clean them had been totally ineffective. The bed was comfortable and the bedding a good quality. The variety of pillows (3) was appreciated. The lighting was good and the two reading lamps were appreciated. There were sufficient plugs for charging. The ample clothes closet had plenty of hangars. There was a desk with a straight back chair and a reasonably sized table with a"
50,"I stayed at the Barceló for a recent humanitarian business trip to Guatemala and was very pleased.  The complementary airport shuttle (to and from) was reliable, clean, and efficient.  I booked online from the United States and my registration and checkout were both very smooth with no confusion, long waits, or surprises.  Staff throughout the hotel were courteous, helpful, and professional.    My booking included breakfast: my schedule started early each day so the 6 am restaurant opening was most appreciated, the offerings were varied and delicious, and the seating was plentiful even during busy times.  My room was quite satisfactory: the facility overall seems to be aging gracefully, but the room was clean and comfortable, the bed/pillows/linens were clean and fresh, and the"
50,Hotel was excellent and had a great stay.  Hotel very clean and staff excellent.  Would recommend your hotel to friends and family.  Great experience.  Vary comfortable stay with your hotel.  The grounds were vary clean and beautiful.
50,"First thing, I got a little ""welcome to the hotel"" gift, which was a big fruit plate (assorted apples, banana, grapes, kiwi, date). The room was big, clean, with a balcony that offered a great view of the city, big and comfy beds, the bathroom was big enough, filled with all ammenities, two shower robes, 4 big towels and 2 small ones, you get shampoo, conditioner and shower gel from dispensers in the shower aside from the ones they include in the travelers kit. The breakfast included is buffet, with many options, from frijoles negros to assorted cereals, it was really good for me and my mother, who traveled with me. I also ate at the Sushi restaurant, a little expensive but you get good food, so it's worth the price, also the waiters at this restaurant were the best! The sports"
50,Was a beautiful experience to be there. Hopefully I can be there again next year.  They have a good service and good facilities. You need try there breakfast with extended hour and great options to chose wherever you like.
50, Great place to stay and enjoy all the services they offer. Staff is very good in helping you out and guiding you too great place to visit. Great restaurants to choose from and all of them have great service
40,"staff service was ok, room felt old but still ok, bed and pillow were good to have a pleasant sleep.  different option of restaurant inside the hotel, at different price range, but not in the cheap section.  the room were clean"
40,Very nice hotel with excellent service. Great value for your money. Location is not the best (therer aren´t many attractions or good restaurants around) but for a business trip is conveniently located.
50,"This was a pleasure trip very enjoyable they just need a discotect inside property, food exelent good choices for international clientele  transport to the airport exceptional driver very friendly this hotel is really 5 stars like I say they just need more night entertainment "
50,"The rooms are very good along with the excellent service. Airport shuttle was included, and the breakfast buffet has a huge selection of excellent quality. Only drawback to breakfast was the coffee is not that good considering Guatemalan coffee is excellent. You will be completely satisfied staying at Barcelo Guatemala City"
40,"if you are asking if you should stay here or not I would say sure check it out, why not? its clean, safe and centrally located. the shower water pressure will power wash your skin, that's pretty cool."
50,"Close to malls, paseo cayala and a lot of Uber's frequent the area. Great informative staff. Breakfast has a lot of options for any picky eater. Has it's own private parking and security at all hours. "
40,"If it weren't for some funky booking reservations and credit card problems they'd get Excellent review. The gym for guys was super expansive and impressed me compared to other hotels of similar price range. The credits are processing was peculiar. We had reservations made on line and communication with Spain to secure the room, then when we arrived they asked again for another credit card as if we never confirmed earlier. Asides from that arriving to room late night with room service and fresh fruit in the room was pleasant. The views were not  great but at least they had a cute little balcony. I'd stay there again assuming you won't find much better accommodations in town."
10,"I think the hotel gets its 5 stars for the number of rooms and facilities on offer, however, it is not of a 5 star standard. Decor is outdated. The food is the worse thing about it - absolutely awful. "
50,The hotel is situated in Zona 10 which is the Business district of the City. I stayes for 5 days. I had an excellent stay. Hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpfull. The pool was excellent. The outdoor jacuzi was excellent too. Very good and spaciou gym. Spacious rooms amd fast wifi. The quality of the food in the restaurant was very good and prices were cheap. Highly recommended.
50,"We arrived late because it looked like this hotel was just average and I did not want to spend our afternoon there. I has pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel. It was clean, updated, beautiful with a wonderful friendly staff. Wish we had arrived earlier to enjoy the amazing buffet at the La Vista restaurant. Next time."
50,"I had a good stay the Barceló: the staff were friendly and the food was ok with some healthy options. There is a McDonalds next door which makes better coffee, and if you want to exercise you can run on Reforma."
50,Had a great overnight stay while travelling thru Guatemala City. The hotel is safe clean and the staff were excellent. Beautiful breakfast bar poolside to enjoy the outdoors. The best coffee in Guatemala.
40,The shuttle left us at the airport at 10 pm knowing that the airport is closed avery day at 10pm to 2 am. They did not say anything or verify before leaving. .very poor service for that. The rest was very good.
50,"My mission trip team arrived late after a delayed flight, and the kind staff at the Barcelo did all they could to get us in our rooms quickly.  They were organized and efficient.  The rooms were clean and nice.  Some of us enjoyed a quick bite, good beer, and some dancing at the adjoining sports bar.  Some of our rooms had a great view of the volcano.  The breakfast buffet the next morning was excellent.  "
50,"My group of 20 Americans arrived late at night after a delayed flight, and we found quick food and decent beer at the adjoining sports bar.  The staff was excellent as they took care of our room assignments and answered all our questions.  View of the volcano was unique, especially from the bustle of the city.  The buffet breakfast in the morning was excellent.  Nobody got sick, and everyone was refreshed.  Big win."
40,"We had an overnight stay in Guatemala City as we had a very early flight the next day. We chose the Barcelo for its proximity to the airport.   Upon arrival, check-in was quick and easy. The desk can be a little hard to find, but just keep walking through the lobby area and you will get there eventually! We had asked for a room on the highest floor, and were given a corner room on floor 10, which meant that we had two balconies, each facing a different direction. This was nice, although the views of Guatemala City are not the most inspiring. Our room was not quite ready, as we had arrived in the morning, so we stored our bags and then went into Guatemala city.   There are two cash machines in the lobby, and we took money out here to avoid having to withdraw it in town. There is"
50,"It would be the best hotel the you could find in the Guatemala City. Great hotel room, safe, clean, kind staffs, great swimming pool. Also the room service quality is great. I would definitely recommend this place. "
50,"This is a great place to stay if you are visiting Guatemala City.  The staff is kind and helpful.  The hotel has a complete list of required amenities.  The hotel shuttle is quick, easy and regular.  The concierge is very helpful and the staff is very considerate about travelers visiting with limited Spanish proficiency."
10,"Unfortunately we had a bad experience with this hotel. From downstairs if seems beautiful and luxury, but the room was really dirty. Our sheets had blood spot. There were hairs in the shower. The floor was so dirty. Fortunately we had to spend there only one night but we were really disappointed, especially because it was supposed to be a 5 star hotel!! "
30,"Though the rooms are spacious and the beds are nice, the management should ask the maids about the basic services in the room.  The shower drain was stuck shut and was not something that had just happened.  The room on the 8th floor faced two busy main arteries and I could not sleep after 5 am once the morning traffic started.  "
50,"Service was great.  Everyone spoke english and spanish.  With few little issues, when addressed things were remedied immediately and with great service.   The pool was great and the breakfast buffet was phenomenal!  I'll be returning here when I need a place to unwind and relax!"
40,"stayed here for 2 nights in Feb 2017, efficient check in and check out, the room was clean, roomy  the staffs were good, polite,helpful the foods in the restaurant were tasty , with a lot of fresh fruits"
50,"The hotel was in a good location, it had a booth to book excursions that seemed at a reasonable price. It was very safe, it has a nice pool and several dining options. It has a great breakfast buffet. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at Barceló again."
50,"Indeed a truly wonderful hotel! I just wanted to personally say THANK YOU to Oscar from the front desk. He was very knowledgeable, courteous, and very helpful. It is great to know that the hotel provides complimentary shuttle services from the airport to the hotel."
30,"Swimming pool is nice, hot tub is not hot. Had to move us twice before we got a room with hot water. We have stayed here before and the hot tub is always disappointing but hot water in the room wasn't a problem before. I would have rated the service better but they offered nothing for the problem but apologies."
50,"Barcelo location was excellent, the shuttle to and from airport was good only a few minutes from airport. Room was clean and stocked with everything you forgot. The food was good, room service was quick and the staff was excellent. "
50,"I don't really write reviews but I had to take time to simply say that The Barcelo Hotel will be the only hotel I will ever stay at when I visit Guatemala for any reason. They went above and beyond my expectation. Simply put ""Best Experience Everc"
50,"Beautiful hotel. Nice swimming pool and restaurants. The staff was great and spoke good English. I was able to change money there.  It was close to the airport, the shuttle service to and from the airport was excellent."
40,"It's a practical hotel if you're there for business. Shuttle is free to and from the airport, breakfast and WiFi included. Breakfast buffet has a lot of options. The rooms are a bit dated and you can't really walk anywhere near."
10,I took a taxi and came to the entrance. Employees were helping other customers with their baggage. When it was my turn... all I got was a look from one of the employees. He couldn't believe that someone who does not look white and blond will have the money or the right to stay in that place. He did not help me with my bag the way they did to others. I did not get mad but I was sad. You come to tour country and this is what you find. A guest is a guest and it does not matter how he looks. 
40,"We asked for a room with balcony and they gave us a room without. So we called the reception from the room asking if there is a mistake, they said no, they just Upgraded our room for a bigger one but no balcony. It's fine that they don't have one, but they should let us know at the reception. In fact, they do have rooms with balcony, but they didn't want to give it to use and keep saying that is a very small room. At the end, we still took the Small room with balcony and it came out that it's they same size as the one as the Upgraded room. The girl at the reception was a bit upset, she gave us attitude and didn't even look at us for the entire switching keys procedure. She didn't explain anything about the hotel (ex: where do I go for the breakfast? , where is the pool?, where"
50,"There isn't much that attracted me to Guatemala City, and if my flights were different i would have passed straight through, but this hotel was the perfect place to crash out.  Lots of food options (including an american sports bar - like you'd find at an airport), and a coupe of other bars and restaurants.  There staff are helpful and quick to respond.  The rooms are well equipped and comfortable."
50,"I liked this hotel very much.  I plan to stay there every time I visit Guatemala City.  It's nice, very  well kept, comfortable, and the staff is helpful.  It was also very easy to walk to other areas of the city, and quite close to the airport."
50,Centrally located and great value. The hotel is not new but it meets any expectations. I would recommend with family or business and the ambiance is great for both. Located close to great restaurants and even the exit from Guatemala if you are driving.
30,"Too expensive!. Gift shops over priced. Food in the sports bar was badly presented and hardly any meat or cheese in sandwich ""Spanish..."" Enjoyed dinner in Japanese Restaurant. Convenient and free shuttle to the airport. Noisy because of planes taking off."
50,I live in Guatemala and go to the capital about once a month.  This hotel was more than I usually budget for a hotel but well worth.  The breakfast was delicious with many options. The room was quiet.  I will return.
50,The Barceló is one of the best values in Guatemala. Its spacious lobbies and friendly personnel are very welcoming. I make sure to get a massage from Gladys every time I stay. She's excellent! Love this hotel!
30,"Average for price . Food in restaurant horrible otherwise just average . Pool nice rooms ok .lots of amenities . No shuttle early in am , rooms were ok bed hard . Nice pool though and great would stay again if for fast stay but not for a vacation "
50,Barcelo was particularly help with my luggage this trip. They were willing to hold it in their closet until I returned from Tikal. I also love the transport that is always right at the airport when you arrive. It makes such a difference in getting a huge amount of luggage (brought for donations) to the hotel easily.
30,"I spent a night here while transiting through Guatemala City. They seemed to be the only major hotel whose shuttle was not waiting outside La Aurora. I had sent a message ahead to confirm my arrival and received a response, but only when I called them did they send the shuttle. When it did finally arrive, I was kept waiting for another 30 minutes+ while they waited for another couple. I would try to get a taxi instead. The hotel is in a quiet area, nothing much around if you planned to explore the city. Check-in was very swift which I appreciated. The room itself is average, the rooms and furniture definitely on the older side - I would compare it to a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn level of accommodation. Again, it's ok for a quick stay."
30,"This is a really no good hotel, its true its in the center of everything, the rooms are old, bathrooms are old, tv ´s old even carpets and beds, Please avoid this hotel, there are much better options in the city,"
50,outstanding service and corteous. our stay was excellent because the people were very helpful and determined to make our stay the best.. we also enjoyed the food. breakfast in particular. the chefs and the servers pay attention to detail and were always around. we also saw how the make rugs for an upcoming convention out of wood and sand. 
40,"Recently spent two nights at Barcelo. Check in very efficient. They upgraded our room. Beds very comfy, rooms quite spacious. Restaurant food delicious! The staff excellent. Plus there is free shuttle service to the airport. A great overall experience."
20,"The shuttle to the hotel is a great benefit. The shuttle can be found at the passenger’s exit, a white bus with “Barcelo.com” in blue letters on the side. The bus travels from the airport to the hotel every 30 minutes approximately and the driver was pleasant, helpful and friendly. After the pleasant surprise of the shuttle, our stay at the Barcelo Guatemala City started out very, very badly. The front desk staff were the worst of any we have experienced over the past five years. Despite have paid fully in advance, confirming our flight details, and requesting a room as far from elevators as possible, our room was not ready when we tried to check in at 2:30pm on Saturday 1st July, the check in person stated no other rooms were ready, he did not call us when our keys were ready,"
50,"We expect excellence from a chain hotel and this was not the difference. Hotel was very clean, beds are very comfy, well supplied bathroom, shuttle service was very effective we had to catch a flight very early in the morning and they got it there in time (4am)."
50,"Very nice upscale hotel.  Nice lobby with professional reception. Room was very good with all one could need.  Rate did not include breakfast as the rate we received was quite a good discounted internet rate. Nice pool, jacuzzi and lobby bar with luve piano in evenings.  Cafes, restaurants, etc are a few blocks away. "
40,There are plenty staff available and willing to assist. I also felt very safe and secure in this location.  The food was good and the rooms were clean and spacious. They have a beautiful facility and the amenities are superb. I would definitely visit this hotel again.
50,A place to stay in a peaceful environment in Guatemala. Just close to the airport with shuttle services. The restaurant it's excellent and the lobby bar too. The hotel is very clean and the staff just want to help you
50,Stayed in the hotel for a few days and also had the morning buffet in the restaurant.  The rate was good for this hotel. The hotels location is both close to the airport as well as shopping and restaurants. Service in this hotel is excellent. The pool is great. 
40,"Bathroom has no fan, smell and humidity were in the room. Everything else was perfect. The cleanliness was perfect. I regret renting only one night, this hotel is recoment ut for ar least 2 nights. Enjoy"
40,"Barceló is a great hotel located a few kilometers from the Aurora International Airport in a safe neighborhood. Although the hotel is somewhat outdated, the rooms are great and clean. The bathroom is well-maintained and somehow ample. The staff at the front desk is amicable and willing to help. Breakfast is ok with major fruits and dishes to choose from. The hotel also offers a shuttle service free of charge to the airport. This is a great hotel in Guatemala City."
50,"What can I say, the rooms are inviting, the sleeping is good, services are attentive, food is quite a bit better than most and for what I consider a luxury hotel it is quite reasonable.  Breakfast and lunch buffets are quite varied.  Service has been above reproach always."
50,Will do it again I come to Guatemala as much as possible. My wife is from there. I have stayed at many hotels and resorts over the last 20 years and the Barcelo was as good as any and better than most thanks for the vacation
40,"I brought a group to Guatemala (my 4th trip there) & we stayed at the Barcelo for our first 2 nights.  The facility is nice.  Room service was good. Nice shopping (surprisingly good prices on souvenirs!!) & we loved that we were right next to Mc Donald's as we were traveling with some teens & didn't want the $13 Barcelo breakfast both days... be forewarned, eat your food at mc d's (or Pizza Hut, or...) as the hotel does NOT allow people to EAT any other food in the hotel premises except for in your own room.   I've never experienced that before at ANY hotel in ANY country I've been to prior to this. They literally will ask you to go to your room while drinking your coke or eating an ice cream while walking into the hotel!  I felt they came across as a bit snobbish in"
50,I usually stay here when I visit the capital. It has all the big city hotel amenities with reliable quality. Great breakfast buffet. The rooms are quiet and well-appointed. The beds are breat with about 15 pillows!
50,"I chose this place based on my husband's good experience last year. Since I will be traveling by myself into Guatemala City for the first time, I decided to stay at Barceló because I want to have a good first night. However, my husband did not use the shuttle service nor the ATM when he was in Guatemala City last year and failed to warn me (my story follows below!). :)  Barcelo definitely met my expectation. The room was nice and clean. The staff were very helpful. The breakfast and dinner were delicious (coffee was very good at the breakfast!). I would highly recommend anyone visiting Guatemala to stay here.  Now comes my ATM story. Barceló gets a big bonus point from me because it has ATM right in the lobby! While this might not seem important in other cities, in this case, it"
30,"this is a nice Hotel probably best 20 years ago, need to upgrade rooms , air condition, chairs at restaurant, GYM , but People service are outstanding same as food at restaurant and laundry. if you go for business is OK. do not go with your family "
40,"I have always liked this hotel, but this time I was left to wait at the airport for 25 minutes at 10:30 pm because the first van(10 seats) would only take the 5 airline crew members.  The 3 paying customers were left to wait."
40,"Very Good service, and I would come back when I have the chance, my  family and guests really loved it, that's why I wanted to come back, it probable will be for more time, and I hope that you guys have the same services in other countries or better, thanks guys for all your help, thanks."
40,"The people are nice and the room was clean and the bed comfortable enough.  The best thing about this hotel is that the price is always good.   The pool and hot tub area are very pleasant, and the food is good.    My only complaint was being woken up 3 times by housekeeping. One time was to give me matches in the middle of the night. I bought my concern up with the front desk but never received an apology."
30,"I used to love this hotel, but during our last stay I could see a couple of thinks that need to be updated, specially the area of the steam room. It is dirty, with slippery floors and the area really needs an update."
40,Generally very nice hotel. Always make me feel welcome. Rooms comfortabe and well maintained.  Two problems. 1. Constant problem with the electronic room key cards. 2. Enrolling in rewards program never seems to work. 
40,"BARCELO HOTEL Guatemala City is a very comfortable hotel at a great price.  Once a Marriott hotel, the facilities and restaurants are clean and with the best hotel pool and spa facilities in Guatemala City!   There are three hotel restaurants and many more dining options within a ten minute walk and also a nearby mall for shopping needs.  The rooms are comfortable, although the beds were a bit too firm for me and all the pillows are the same—very mushy.  I stayed on the sixth floor and a few days later on the tenth floor so I noticed that some of the rooms have been renovated and others have not.   The front desk is efficient although the maintenance staff may or may not fix a room problem the first time.  I had to request twice for the bathtub drain plug to be repaired as it"
50,"This hotel is very very good. Rooms are very nice, food is perfect for every taste. Nice pool and gym area. It is in a very secure area, close to a super market in case you need to get anything. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. It also has a free airport service, but we went there with a tour, so I am not sure if they pick everybody from airport."
50,Stayed here for one night with a couple of friends before flying out the next morning. Hotel is beautiful and service is friendly. Good location in a relatively safe area. We were able to walk to restaurants. Shuttle was great to the airport the next morning.
50,"Very nice hotel with beautiful swimming pool, nice rooms and super close to the airport. I ate at La vista and although a little pricey, the food was good. The balcony was a very nice addition to the room, and the door was able to block the live music that was coming from the bar across the street. "
40,"We stayed here three times over a period of 10 days as a part of a tour. The first night was at the beginning of the tour. We arrived At 8:30am from the airport and were given our room right away. No waiting, no usual reminders of the check in time. On the last day also they allowed us to check out at 2:00 to accommodate our late flight. The breakfast buffet was great."
40,"It was a torrential downpour when I arrived. I was greeted at the valet area with someone carrying an umbrella. After arriving already wet, I didn't need it. But that was nice if I were in a suit. The staff is great and really wants you to feel special - genuinely.  The room was nice and uses the key card method for your lights and air conditioner. The room was clean. The only drawback was the bed was very hard. I had enough pillows on the King size bed to fabricate an impromptu pillow-top mattress.  My flight departed at 7, so I had to catch the 5am shuttle and missed out on the free breakfast. I asked if they had any coffee and was told no. Within seconds after I asked, they brought out coffee for the departing flight crews. They put the coffee and snacks right next to my"
50,Barceló has shuttles that will pick you up at the airport which is nice. The hotel is so nice and grand. There are several dining choices in the hotel as well as within walking distance from the hotel. We enjoyed the sports bar there. The swimming pool and hot tub is a great treat when you need to wind down. The staff are very nice and speak English very well. A great place to start and end your trip in Guatemala. Well worth the price!
50,"The Barceló hotel is absolutely a recommendable place to stay, nice staff, safe place and big rooms , comfortable beds and clean and good conditioned sanitary rooms. I missed at least one multi socket for EU Plugs, which is standard in lots of hotels already, so do not forget to bring an adapter if you don't have the America plug with you. Unfortunately I had no breakfast, I was leaving to early. The only thing I would change was the aroma in the air of my room. I don´t like it, when everything is covered with artificial aromas and there were only small windows to open."
40,"This hotel is great, it's located in a great zone (Zona 9) with great service and the price is affordable . From there you can access the Aurora Inetrnational airport and its locates near the Zona 10, one of the best places in Guatemala City."
40,"Great food at Restaurant, rooms are very clean and secure and nice place to stay... only issue  it is GYM is very small and few workout equipment exept this . I recomend this Hotel your next trip to Guatemala."
40,"I stayed here for an extended duration and found the experience very agreeable. It's in a reasonable part of the city and the hotel facilities go beyond normal corporate standards. There are shops, tourism services and I particularly recommend the pool and leisure area which is bigger and better than average. The staff are extremely courteous and professional, especially the housekeeping team who are as dilligent and thorough as any I have ever come across. Definitely one to return to in the future."
40,The hotel Mgmt only reacted to more Money $$$$. During our 4 days business meetings the smallest request was heard only if we paid additional $$$.  Even the ear piece which goes along with the electronic piece was additional money.
50,"I travel a lot to Guatemala for studies, and I always stay in Barcelo and it already feels like home. People are nice and available for you at all times. The hotel is extremely clean and the rooms are spacious and with awesome views of the city. The breakfast is extremely delicious and with so many options. The pool is climatized and you´ll love the jacuzzi. Everything in th hotel is perfect o make your stay as pleasant as can be!!"
40,"I recently stayed in the Barcelo Hotel in Guatemala City with a large group of friends and colleagues The rooms were clean, quiet and comfortable. The security was evident but not obtrusive. The showers were hot, the staff were courteous and helpful in English and Spanish. The dining room menu and buffet options were imaginative exemplifying different cultural cuisines and the pianist in the foyer was a relaxing reminder of grand hotels of yesteryear. Particularly noteworthy were the spectacular flower arrangements in key locations."
30,"Stay for 2 nights for the beginning of the tour then 1 night at the last day of the tour the hotel is closed to the GUA so it convenient and quick to get to and from the airport few restaurants in the hotel,including one Japanese, and buffet the room is clean, plenty of space"
50,"We stayed at this hotel one night while travelling through. It is safe,clean, and very high end. I had a massage again with Gladys and it was excellent! The buffet breakfast was also good. We tried the Japanese Resturant but wouldn't go again there."
50,"We spend 2 nights at the start of our tour with Caravan, and it was good that the hotel has a shuttle from the airport. The rooms are very nice. big and clean. The food at the hotel was very good with buffet at breakfast and also for dinner and lunch. It has a very good swimming pool. Also on the way back we spend a night there and had a very nice farewell dinner for the group. It has free wifi in all the places."
50,"The hotel is nice, check in and out was effortless. It has a few restaurants and we only tried the sport bar but left when we saw how expensive it was (3 times normal prices, for drinks anyway). We went to hang at the pool but it was crawling with kids, and not a single table or chair open. Granted it was a long weekend and mid afternoon. Nice/decent pool area though. Shops looks ""hotel-nice"". Bed was good, bedding was good, water pressure was good, coffee in room was Horrible. We dumped it...sad since we love coffee. Nice to have robes and slippers, windows blocked noise very well, and opened to a little private patio, but we were on the 3rd floor so had a view of an industrial looking roof only.  I could not get the wifi in the room to work for me :/  We stayed here because we"
50,"I took the vacation for one, I truly enjoyed my stay . The hotel was very clean and the service was friendly. The tours they had available for singles were very minimal. I was unsure of what actives to do outside of the hotel. The breakfast provides many options "
40,"This hotel seems to be a primary hotel for business travelers and groups. Their rooms are comfortable and adequate, though certainly not fancy or elegant. Unfortunately, the wifi was usually weak and at times non functional in guests rooms. The lobby and common areas were pleasant and furnished with comfortable chairs. The restaurants and bars were quite expensive and not very good. The free breakfast was fine, and guests could order individually eggs and omelets, etc. The gym was adequate, as was the pool. We also took advantage of the free shuttle to the airport which was convenient and free. "
40,"The Hotel Barcelo is a high-end, full-service hotel in Zona 9 of Guatemala City. The fitness center is spread across several rooms, including weights and cardio, exercise classrooms, a large pool, and a hot tub. The 9th floor premier room offers snacks and drinks with a view of the city. The ground floor restaurants are very good, and the breakfast buffet is quite a spread.  Staff are helpful and conversant in English. The bill can even be converted to US dollars if you like."
50,"Super kind, professional and helpful staff. Comfortable room with a great shower. Best pool/hot tub we have ever experienced. We left an item and the were very accommodating in helping us get it back. Business services was saved our lives! "
40,"Needs to improve some things like night life activities and Wi-fi connection, you can't get visitors in your room 👎🏻 everything needs a key to work...even to go to the pool, gym, elevator,etc... it feel like a prison."
40,"Recommendation Get the breakfast hotel package, it's much cheaper  Pros - Very safe high security - There different restaurants within the building (sports bar, Japanese and buffet dinners - Right next door to McDonald's - Clean - Good amenities downstairs  - Offer free shuttle pick up which is great  Cons - Extremely slow internet for a higher end hotel - Mini bar fridge has a lock "
30,"This hotel was very nice. I would advise you to stay clear of the Sushit restaurant.  Rooms are very tasteful and luxurious. Staff was not that helpful! Again, please don't eat at the Sushi restaurant if you are a foreign traveler."
50,"my hubby and i stayed 1 night before our 7AM flight. the hotel is very nice with professional staff. our room was spacious and clean with all the modern amenities. there is an hourly complimentary shuttle to the airport starting at 4AM.  there are several fast food restaurants within walking distance if you need a quick bite and didn't pack fancier clothes for their upscale restaurants!  if you sign up for their club at no charge (similar to Fairmont President's Club), you get 2 drink tix (non-alc) at their bar. a fruit tray was also delivered to our room tho i am not sure if that was a perk for all new patrons or for having signed up.  when i called to make the reservation, the call center didn't know about the early shuttle and i was told i might need to pay for a cab. but"
30,"I visited this hotel on business and I should admit now that I was a bit jet-lagged when I got there. Also I did not eat there. The initial impressions were very good as the reception area was very grand and spacious. However I fell out with the lift big time as you had to put your card in a slot and then the buttons you pressed were pretty temperamental and often chose not to take me to my floor. The rooms were OK but were looking as tired as I was. There were inadequate sockets for the modern business user. The other thing that irritates me even when not jet-lagged is there was no master switch for all the lamps scattered around the room so they had to be turned on and off individually. As I was not there for long I did not interact with many of the staff, however those that I"
50,"Enjoyed every aspect of our stay at the Barcelo Guatemala City. Very comfortable rooms, great service, and the breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets wre tops.The ammenities were great also. Will certainly return  1"
40,"We paid about $90 for a room for three people. The hotel is very clean with a giant pool, hot tub, several restaurants to choose from, and a bar. It's an excellent choice for Guatemala City and a much better value than some of the other nice hotels in the area. I definitely recommend it!"
30,"This was a good hotel for our last two nights traveling through Central America. It was walking distance to the popular shopping and eating areas otherwise known as the ""Safe"" zone. Supposedly, we were upgraded from our original booking which came with a balcony, but the ""upgrade"" did not have a balcony. The room was fine but the hotel is also a convention center and the place was busy. Lots of security patrolling the lobby and areas. Didn't feel too comfortable there.   The pool is nice although I could not find the spas that are mentioned in the hotel guide book. Breakfast buffet was average as well. Oh well. We were there to wait for our flight."
40,"Nice property with a variety of souvenirs stores. The breakfast was awesome, with a plenty variety of local and international food. The first room assigned was the 1001 but there was a lot of noise on the roof, apparently A/C machines are on the rooftop, the front desk team handle my situation very nice and they proceed with a room move to the 919, I recommend this 919 room to any traveler.  Also the pool area was really cool!"
30,"Was not that impressed. A outdated and paper thin walls. When I say paper-thin, I mean paper thin! I can hear EVERYTHING. Not the usual Barcelo property I'm used to around the world. Only good thing was the service and the location close to the airport. Price was okay too. "
40,"Very good located in Zona 9, plus several restaurants to choose, especially the Sport Bar, live music on Thurdays.  In the best part of Guatemala City called, Zona Viva near all the good places to visit. A very good service!  Include the breakfast, it is a very good Buffet!"
10,"Scammers, I visited this Hotel in December, I made the reservation through the website, they offered me a room with balcony, but at the time I check in the agent with no sense of hospitality told me that those rooms were not available at the moment. and he turn around and left. That's it. Room Service is overpriced, EVERYTHING there is super expensive. The cleaning lady was super nice, but management is unpleasant. too bad."
50,"If you need to go to Guatemala, for any reason take this option, close to all attractions, you can enjoy a nice dinner on the hotel, or a drink (zacappa local rum), or just walk to any close places, is a safe area, and its about 1 hour away from Antigua! Love that place, the rooms was clean, nice and lovely, elevators to our beedroom make some noise looks like  need some maintenance, TV is nice, Minibar is Great, they have turnover service also ! Great breakfast"
50,"We have always enjoyed staying at this location.  There is shuttle service to and from the airport to/from the hotel.  The shuttle service is every hour on the hour.  And we have been fortunate not to wait very long when we arrive at GUA airport for the shuttle to arrive.  The pool is awesome.  The service is good.  The breakfast buffet is very good.  We like to order our omelet and then get the other items on the plate and then come back for the finished product.  I always enjoy the fresh juice - especially the watermelon juice.  There is fresh fruit and bakery items, plus your normal other items like yogurt, ham, cheese, black beans etc.  The only downfall of the breakfast buffet, is that our flight leaves out at 6am, and we need to catch an early shuttle so we miss out on the"
40,"Very nice hotel near the airport, zoo, restaurants etc.  What I liked most was the hotel was very secure and safe.  There were always security people standing at every entrance and all around the property.  The staff were very quick to take care of any request or need.  They also ran a free shuttle to and from the airport every hour on the hour even late into the night (when our flight arrived).  Room was nice, quiet and comfortable.  The only negative of the room was the T.V. was fuzzy and all stations in spanish.  Breakfast was also not free which would have been a bonus if it was."
40,"stayed here for one night, 10mins approx. from airport so very handy.  Very nice hotel, a good choice of buffet breakfast, staff very pleasant and attentative in restaurant. has an airport shuttle bus which I think runs hourly."
50,"I was delighted to find a very high quality hotel in the middle of Guatemala City. Room was large, spacious, and beautifully appointed. Bed super comfortable. Large, lovely bath. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. All for a mere $77.00 per night. Delicious food in hotel restaurant as well, again very reasonable priced. AS a single traveler, I felt very safe in this hotel."
50,"We stayed here 1 night with my family. We booked online since it was cheaper. The hotel was very nice, clean, and welcoming. They also provided us with free airport transportation.  Will come back and stay here. "
50,"We stayed at the Barcelo when we first arrived in Guatemala and knew that we would not be able to make it to Lake Atitlan.  The room was comfortable and was as expected.  It was clean with a nice bathroom.  The breakfast was very good.  You cannot go wrong with an omelette.  They have various fresh juices that are very good.  Of course, the coffee is also good.  You can really pack it up very well so that you really only need a small lunch.  We then stayed at the Barcelo for the ending of our trip and spent 2 nights.  The second stay was better because we were in the tower that overlooks the entrance to the hotel and to the airport.  we had to do room service for breakfast the 2nd morning since our flight was at 8:00AM and breakfast starts at 6:00am.  Room service was good and"
50,"Stayed two nights in Guatemala on first trip to the country. Hotel is excellent, i.e., close to airport, amenities, pool, breakfast, etc. On our return at the end of trip we chose a different hotel, simply because of the walking around possibilities. Barcelo, while near shopping and restaurants, requires a precarious walk across Reforma traffic to reach them. I would not hesitate to stay here again for a quick overnight before or after a trip."
30,"We stayed here for two nights when we first arrived in Guatemala. We had a corner room on a higher floor with two outdoor patios and nice views of Guatemala City. The hotel is a bit outdated but the price is right. It's in a great location, near the airport but you wouldn't know it. The buffet breakfast was included and was quite good. The hotel pool is really nice. It's definitely worth planning to spend some time at the pool while staying here. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent."
50,"We stayed at the Barceló Guatemala City for one night in order to easily go to the airport very early the next morning.  The hotel is located in a safe zone with tree lined streets within 15 minutes of Aurora airport. The public areas, the room and bathroom were all immaculate. The bathroom was well supplied with soaps, shampoos, creams and even a toothbrush and tooth paste.  The reception desk personnel were very polite and efficient.  The hotel is large and there were employees stationed conveniently around the huge lobby area to give directions to different parts of the hotel and to the area outside of the hotel.  There is a very large, heated outdoor pool and spa area with a bar/restaurant pool side.  We had a king sized bed that was extremely comfortable and had ample"
50,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Lovely rooms (I had a balcony with a view of the city which was great especially at night). Great pool area. Food was good and because we were with a tour we had buffet with many choices of cold and hot items. Reasonably priced for such service! I would certainly not hesitate to stay here again.
50,"A great base from which to start or end your trip to Guatemala or for business. It is about 5-10 min from the airport and runs a shuttle service.  The buffet breakfast, although not as great as it used to be, is still pretty good - only the coffee is bad! A very nice pool as well and within walking distance of Zone 10 and a multitude of restaurants and bars and a movie theatre at Proceres."
40,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel and were pleased with the rooms and service.  It was reasonably priced, has transportation to and from airport.  We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and shops (if you are a little adventures).  Very nice pool and hot tub.  Service was a little slow at the bar.  Room's were nice and had nice 2 person balcony."
50,This is a excellent hotel to stay in Guatemala city.Very close  to the airport and has a free airport shuttle. The rooms are very comfortable and the beds are superb. This is our sixth stay in the hotel.
40,"The Barcelo Guatemala City is fairly close to the airport, which makes for easy access but also means that you hear the planes overhead. In addition, it is on a very busy street so that you can hear traffic noises inside your room. The room itself is a nice size, with ample drawer space, closet with bathrobe (for sale) and slippers( for free). There are many amenities in the bathroom, which is on the small side, but big enough for one person to use at a time. Note that both the drain stopper on the sink as well as in the tub, is released by pushing down on it.  The buffet restaurant offers lots of hot and cold choices from which to choose. You can't leave hungry.  There are several hotel shops, but, since this is the first stop on my visit, I can't say whether the prices are"
50,My wife and i spent one night here during a stop over to our final destination. the free shuttle service was great. the hotel itself was very nice. the employees were attentive and friendly. the sushi restaurant had friendly staff and good food. we would stay again if in guatemala
50,"Pleasantly surprised by this deal - especially when upgraded to a suite room, complete with spiral stairs up to bedroom, beautiful windows overlooking the city with remote curtain control, well furnished, comfy beds. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Only there for an overnight before flight out, so didn't explore the area much, but very convenient to the airport - 10-minute shuttle ride."
50,Whenever I am visiting Guatemala I often have an evening that I must spend in Guatemala City. I am either waiting to be picked up by missionaries from Xela or I am getting ready to go home to the US. Whatever my need I am always welcomed with a full complement of services. They hold my bags while I wait to be picked up or they take me to a wonderful room with heavenly beds. The buffet breakfast comes with the room and is every bit as nice as a high-end hotel in the large cities of Europe. This hotel is reasonably priced and a good section of town.
50,"Checked in March 2 and are staying 3 nights. Hotel shuttle picked up at the airport. Hotel has friendly and courteous staff,my husband could not find his passport when we checked. The front desk staff jumped into action, luckily I found had passport. The hotel building and city are super clean. Minutes away from Zoo, we enjoyed the beautiful weather and friendly towns people."
50,We spent three nights here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The front desk personnel were polite and efficient. The suite was nicely furnished and comfortable. The included breakfast was great! Located near the airport and the Zona Viva there are lots of restaurants in the area in addition to the three at the hotel. Would definitely stay here again!
50,"Very nice reception area.  Excellent service at front desk and in the restaurant. Buffet was very good for breakfast and lunch. Would definitely stay here again. Also provide nice robes, slippers and assortment of toothbrush, soap and other amenities. Very comfortable and very close to airport with a shuttle. "
40,"After touring several sights throughout Guatemala, we ended our stay at the Hotel Barcelo.  The hotel is conveniently located a short distance from the airport, and offers the typical amenities of a class hotel.  Check in/out is painless and quick.  Our room, (#901), was very comfortable, nice bath area, and had a balcony on each side of our room.  Our reservation included a fixed priced breakfast served buffet style.  The service was above average. There are several shops within the hotel offering many hand made items which we found to be fairly priced. Leisurely walks are adjacent to the hotel, as are quality restaurants, city attractions, and a small market, all considered within the safe zone."
50,"The BARCELO is a real 5-star hotel offering high standard rooms, all required amenities, perfect reception services. The breakfast buffet includes outstanding food and the night club had good jazz music. We had to leave early at 4:00 AM to catch our flight and they prepared for us breakfast boxes."
50,I have stayed at the Barcelo the last three times I was in Guatemala City.  The rooms are very nice. I have always had a terrace with sliders you can open for fresh air. The breakfasts are great and you can eat healthy or otherwise.  The Japanese restaurant in the hotel is excellent. The gym is really good for a hotel gym. Ask where the members only gym is as it is better outfitted. A great sauna and pool and jacuzzi.  All in all a very nice experience.
50,"Stayed at hotel for 3 nights as part of a tour on Guatemala. Checking in was very easy, room had great view of area and was very clean. Most enjoyable part of hotel was the buffet both at breakfast and dinner. Great options to choose from each day, and staff were always helpful keeping your coffer cup full. Located in area that is safe to walk around during the day, but staff suggested that leaving grounds at night would not be a good idea."
50,"This is a beautiful, upscale hotel in a busy section of the city where we stayed for 3 nights as a treat after a family event.    Our room was impeccable and  ready upon our arrival ; had many amenities including robes, mini fridge and great coffee.  Housekeeping was excellent with some minor difficulties in the bathroom,, which could use a bit of updating.   Lobby area is spacious and all staff was pleasant and helpful with our questions. Checkout was quick and simple.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding, as well as the lunchtime menu. Pool and gym are well maintained. It is within walking distance to 3 malls and a small, well stocked grocery store.  Would definitely stay here again."
50,"I went for business to the city and the Barcelo was a great option. Took the shuttle from the airport, the staff is very kind and helpful, the rooms are very good, comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was great, there are 3 restaurants, and room service has very good options. Used the gym, was very good, there are two, one bigger until 10pm and a small one 24 hours. Will stay again"
30,We stay here every year before heading into the mountains.  The plumbing is obsolete. it is rather battered. Good enough but way past its prime.  The bar is good . The breakfast buffet is great.  But ...
50,"This hotel was an excellent choice, located near the airport, worked perfectly for an early morning flight. Our checkin was prompt and we had dinner there at the hotel, it went bad for hotel food. I'd stay there again!"
50,"We stayed here for the first two and the last night of our Guatemala tour. Modern and up-to-date accommodations. Our room's balcony overlooked the roof, but we weren't there for the view, so it didn't really matter. Staff was nice. We enjoyed the restaurant's buffets."
50,"The Barceló stands out among hotels in that the service is great and the accommodations are greater.  It's not really a luxury hotel, but it sure has everything you could want.  Room amenities are outstanding and it's convenient to the airport.  They have an especially nice sports bar with lots of memorabilia, much of it American.  Dining choices include the sports bar (Striker's) , a restaurant with a buffet, and a Japanese restaurant.  There is also a variety of shops adjacent to the lobby. We came in dragging after an overnight flight and, rather than make us wait until check in time, put us in a room at 1100 which won our hearts right then and there.  They also have a pool and super comfortable beds."
50,We arrived a full day ahead of time before our Guatemalan country tour.  Picked up at the airport by tour shuttle and taken to hotel.  Check in was quick and painless. Room was fabulous.  We decided to check out the surrounding area and found out there were two museums and a zoo within walking distance so we chose to visit the museums.  Well worth the walk and entrance fee.  Especially the museum as many of the places we visited on the tour referenced much of the things we saw in the museum.  All hotel staff were cordial and very helpful during our stay (we were there three different nights during our 11-day tour).
40,"I had stayed here before a long time ago when it was a Marriott. Barcelo has done a nice job of keeping up the property. Room service is excellent, they have a variety of bars, and restaurants, and it is very safe. Ask for a higher floor, away from the main street as there is a lot of traffic in the area. If you want more space, you can ask for the 2 story suite which feels a lot less like a hotel. Pool area is very nice, and the workout area is 3 stars at best. Try Kyoto's Japanese food for dinner. Great sushi!   Definitely not 5 stars, but it is great value."
40,"I was pleased with this hotel. The rooms were clean, well equipped, and reasonably priced. We were close to Zone 10 which had a number of restaurants that I wanted to try. The sports bar located within the hotel was reasonably priced by American standards. The front desk people were very helpful as were the staff in the business center."
40,"We arrived at the Barcelo a few days ahead of our Guatemalan country tour and were picked up by the Barcelo's complimentary shuttle from the airport. We opted for the executive floor, staying over the Christmas holidays, selecting the Premium Level Duplex Suite. It was a two storey suite, with a bathroom, living room, TV, computer desk area, minibar, etc on the first level. Climbing the circular staircase, the second level had a king bed ( with comfortable pillows and bedding) a second bathroom, another TV, room safe, ironing board ad iron and some seating. The room was really a bit too large for a hotel stay for just two people. We primarily stayed upstairs, barely using the first floor. Access to the suite was available from both the 11th and 12th, with access to the elevator"
40,It is located in a very convenient zone in Guatemala and access to good places... the service was great and the room was good . It was near to restaurants and the bar in the hotel is great to eat or spent the night with food shows
30,"I just arrive to this hotel to have a single night I choose a two floor room because we were a party of 3 , The room is awesome but the bathrooms were not function properly...and I always insist that a 140 usd room must give you a very good experience and the bath time is one of this true moments of a good hotel. The tempeture of the water was not enough hot and for a cold night at Guatemala was very sad... in this hotel you are close to the airport and a block of distance of Reforma. The breakfast was good and the attitude of most of people great. Except the one that receive and want to change my room for a regular room because was not ready..."
50,The hotel is located in a great place and it is also  close to the airport and the zoo. I will definitely book for a room in this hotel next time in Guatemala. Breakfast is good and the spa for women as the Jacuzzi made our vacation time a comfortable time off.
50,"I've stayed here a few times. Definitely recommend taking the breakfast option. It is very complete and worth the extra charge. Hotel has WiFi, which appeared to be included with all the room rates. Speed was good. The hotel emphasizes security and appears to take it very seriously. The hotel has a tour agency and a Hertz car rental agency. There are restaurants a short walk near the hotel, and a supermarket one block south. Taxi. Fares are usually 50-70 quetzals from the airport, depending on the time of day."
50,"My girlfriend and I spent new years in Guatemala City and everything about the hotel was great. Location, hotel personnel, amenities all worth it. Plenty of places to go nearby and really good dinning inside and out of the hotel. Definitely going back sometime soon!"
50,"We were at this glorious hotel December 30/2016 to January 1st/2017.  Great service, spacious and neat rooms...  immaculate clean. Close to everything.   Nee Year's eve the Hotel gave us a bottle of the finest rum;  Zacapa Centenario. Breakfast Buffet just fantastic "
40,It is a good hotel located in a good area of the city. Several options at walking distance. The service is good and the breakfast pretty good. It definitely needs a makeover because the rooms feel somewhat dated.
40,Easy place to stay when you're in town for business. Airport transportation is easy from the hotel and hotel contains the restaurants and bars necessary for any type of meeting. I would suggest staying every time if you're looking for the most practical location for your business trip
50,"Since my trip to Guatemala, people have asked me which hotels I stayed in and which I liked the best/least.  I have to say, of the four hotels I stayed in during the tour with Caravan that I took a few weeks ago, I LOVED THEM ALL.  Each hotel had a different vibe, but the few things they had in common were:  they were all beautiful, all immaculate, all had excellent regional food and wonderful, responsive and attentive staff.  The Barcelo was our first and last stop in Guatemala City.  Our first night in the City happened to be the evening of December 6th.  Since December 7th starts their Christmas celebrations, we were lucky enough to have a room (with patio) overlooking the city and the fireworks.  They were beautiful, although they couldn't compare to Macy's fireworks in NYC."
40,This property use to be a Marriott and the Barcelo has kept the high standard set by the Marriott.  Perhaps one of the nicest places in Guatemala City to stay.  My only complaint are the beds.  They are super hard and back killers for me.  The breakfast is outstanding and everything is very clean.
50,"I visit Guatemala often on business trip and have stayed at several top hotels.  I like Barcelo for its security customer service, the business center people were very helpful in programming my phone to browse while on the road.  The room is very clean and the airport pick up was fast and professional. This is a great hotel   The buffet is below average compared to the last time I was here. It's either they changed the chef or make some changes to the menu. I tried all the entries and they are packed with sodium, tasteless. Definitely need improve."
50,"This classy hotel is located close to the airport and is in an area of Guatemala City that is quite safe.  The staff is friendly as are many folks in Guatemala.  The buffet meals in the pleasant restaurant have a good variety of food and beverages.  The front desk and business center are mostly staffed by helpful, young adults who speak English well.  It is trendy among young Guatemalans to have names that are popular in the U.S.A. like ""Kimberly"" and ""Bryan.""  I am grateful to Bryan for letting me leave a box of art and history books at the hotel while I went off to tour the country.  Before returning to the U.S.A. I gave them to a campesino family which appreciated them very much.  Thanks, Bryan!"
50,"I had a wonderful time at the Barcelo in Guatemala City. The hotel is conveniently located a few minutes from the airport with a great shuttle to and from. The staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant at the hotel was delicious and the breakfast and dinner were simply fantastic. The room was spacious and well furnished. There were a few things that could improve, but nothing that would change my rating: (1) the bed was very firm. I have a hard time with such hard beds and prefer very soft beds. (2) the tv reception was terrible. Watching any channel was difficult because the quality was so low.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel. I stayed there 3 nights and could not have been more pleased. Careful with the little souvenir store downstairs. Great"
50,"We arrived very late at night and were very impressed with the security at this hotel. It is definitely five star by any countries' standards. The room was beautiful. It has several good restaurants. And there is also the option to go across the street to MacDonalds or Pizza Hut. It has a beautiful outdoor pool and hot tub plus another hot tub, sauna, and steam room at the spa. I used the spa and had the best massage ever from Gloria. Will definitely stay here again when travelling thru Guatemala City!"
40,"This hotel is relatively cheaper than 5 stars hotels and it is located near the airport(closer than any other 4 or 5 stars hotels). They have 3 restaurants: Buffet, Japanese, and sports bar. If you consider the quality of japanese food you can get in Guatemala, it isn´t so bad. Just don´t be expecting a really fresh sashimi or nigiri. The hotel rooms are good and clean."
50,"For Guatemala, this hotel is great. They speak English, the beds are comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is delicious! The wi-fi is good, and the service is good. They offer a lot of amenities such as their pool, spa, and multiple restaurants."
40,"Positive: - great breakfast buffet - rooms are cozy, clean, very quiet - there is swimming pool and fitness space, even a spa if I remember (didn't go to it)  Negative: - Bad coffee (but the McDonalds coffee corner is in the neighbourhood - important for a coffee addict as I am) - Internet is okay in general but in the evening it was not always possible to have a skype without interruptions or quick facebook. In the morning it worked always very well."
30,"I feel like I am missing something.  Barcelona has such good ratings.   We needed a place to stay near the airport.  What we found was a dated, run down rooms (different than dirty), in a slightly unsafe part of the city.  They gave us twin doubles which was a little tight if you prefer to sleep with your spouse.  We also were told we could not leave the block if it was after 9 PM.  I was disappointed with the room.  The lobby and service was fine."
40,"We stay often in this hotel. Great large room, clean, super bed and large bathroom. The hotel has several good facilities. Breakfast is great. One thing...the mens bathrooms were all days without repair (close to reception/ breakfast). Kind if pity. Else it would have been 5 stars "
50,"Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.   Check-in was a breeze, on site parkimg was very convenient.  Close to the airport as well with free parking.   Although the rooms were a little outdated,  beds were very comfortable and there was nothing we could complain about.  Breakfast buffet was awesome and just like the rest of iur experience it was deserving five stars. "
40,"This hotel offers a free shuttle to and from the airport which is very handy.  The beds are very comfortable and clean.  Large fluffy pillows and it was fairly quite on the 11th floor until there was a crying and naked baby in the hallway all by himself...poor thing...the maids helped him to find his mother. Bathroom's are very small.  Breakfast is AMAZING! Hotel front desk staff does speak English! NOTE: If you are traveling with a family, they will charge you $50.00 extra after the 3rd person, even if you book a room for 4 people."
50,"This is a great hotel for business and leisure as well. Service is outstanding. Every one had a smile on their face willing to help in any way they could. Breakfast buffet was very good, and once again great service. The property has a Japanese restaurant and the Strikers Bar, great for burgers, sandwiches and drinks. The heated swimming pool and Gim were fantastic. Rooms are basic, nice and very clean with all the necessary amenities including coffee maker and mini bar.  They do have superior rooms but I didn't check them out.  Also found pricing to be very reasonable.  The hotel has a great location, not far from the airport and within walking distance to other great restaurants. You should try San Martin restaurant, only a few blocks away.  Overall a great experience."
50,"Barcelo Hotels seem to have it all. This was my first experience with Barcelo and it was  a great one. They have a shuttle service to pick you up from the airport. It was easy to find and was waiting for me when I was ready with my bags. The rooms were great. Mine had plenty of room, bottled water waiting for me, and a mini bar to help shake off the stress from traveling. Breakfast the next morning was AMAZING!! A huge buffet with eggs/omelets cooked to order, a huge array of fruit, muffins, meats, and other items that will definitely satisfy any breakfast craving you have. Don't skip their breakfast!"
40,"I always start with the things I love.  I think it's a great location - walking distance to a lot of restaurants, grocery store and the mall.  Beautiful pool area and the restaurant is good.  The only complaint is the beds are rock hard,.. my back was hurting the next morning it was so hard.  I also didn't like the fact that we couldn't bring our own snacks and drinks to the pool.  "
50,"Wife and I are missionaries.  We needed a little get away.  Chose the Barcelo because they offered a missionary discount.  Fantastic place.  Well worth the money.  Breakfast was unbelievable.  The bed was a bit hard, but we slept great anyway.  We like soft beds.."
50,I have been traveling to Guatemala City for several months.  Others had stayed at the Intercontinental.  The rates there continued to climb higher and I looked for another hotel.  The Barceló was recommended and I tried it.  I will never go back to the Intercontinental.  The Barceló has great rates.  Very centrally located near the business district and many good restaurants.  Also has several restaurants on property and a bar.  Excellent pool and spa area too.  This will be my go-to hotel in Guatemala City.
50,"I stayed there few times a year, the personal is very efficient, cordius and helpful. The breakfast buffet is incredible.  Very clean and the location of the hotel is great. They have shuttle TO and FROM the airport.  I  stay IN DIFERENT HOTEL TRUE THE YEARS but know I stay only there."
40,"The service all around is very good: friendly staff, attentive.  Breakfast buffet is a great option to include in your stay.  Fast check-in and check-out.  Provided airport transportation.  The only issue I had was with the internet connection.  ""Regular"" wi-fi is very unstable, which made it impossible for work needs.  The wired network that was provided in the room did not work at all.  After several calls to guest services, they ""fixed"" the issue by providing me with a faster wi-fi password which ended up doing the trick.  I would definitely recommend it, just, if you have internet needs for working while on your trip, make sure you check your connectivity status early in your stay."
30,"Hotel was chosen by a client and I had trepidation based on reviews.  No surprise, it's pretty outdated and shabby.  Old fashioned furniture and bright green carpet in the rooms.  It's oppressive and not cheerful.  The staff is just OK, helpful enough but not overly friendly.  The pool area is stark and ugly.  The location is not great, nothing close to walk to except a McDonald's and supermarket.  I visited the Intercontinental to get an idea for my next trip and it is head and shoulders above the Barcelo.  Located in a walkable area with tons of restaurant options, beautiful lobby and brand new rooms.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Several restaurant options vs. Barcelo has 2 - the Japanese place was never open."
40,"I stopped by Guatemala city for a dinner meeting and stayed at the Barcelo in Guatemala City.  The hotel had very friendly staff and quick to get me my room.  I was very impressed by the amenities the hotel has, as they give you a full variety of things you might need (especially if you lose your luggage).    The only thing that got me on this hotel, was that the building had a very old scent to it.  Nothing too big, but thats what keeps me from giving them an excellent!   so in review:   Internet - excellent Amenities - excellent  Old Smell - very good  service - excellent   I highly recommend the hotel."
50,"I stayed here in 2011, and I came back again a week ago. It was so good in 2011 that I decided to come back. Barcelo is SO close to the airport (about 10 min to get to), and the shuttle runs every hour. That is the biggest plus. The rooms are nice with balconies and good beds. We also enjoy the restaurants inside the hotel (the dinner buffet is a little on high side price-wise, but it is good) plus the little stores they have. The front desk is very helpful with wake up calls and calling to tell you that your tour guide is there. Reservations are easy to make online. The only downside was that we left for a tour at 5 AM, and the hotel would not give us a boxed breakfast unless we paid for it. I think this should be included if you need it because breakfast is already included"
50,we stayed here two nights beautiful pool and spa the breakfast included was incredible the room were very cozy and the noise level was great there were some events going on but we were not disturbed by any of them... the bed was a little firmer than we normally would choose
30,"The positives:  close to airport, fast, efficient airport shuttle goes straight to airport without stopping at other hotels.  Front desk spoke impeccable English.  Beautiful pool area and an interesting-looking restaurant (I didn't eat there.)  Ice machine near elevator.  When I needed a taxi to the hotel, I called the hotel and they sent one to pick me up (at my expense.)  As a woman travelling alone, this felt safer than catching a taxi on my own.  The negatives:  The bed was very hard.  I couldn't get comfortable in it.  It took so long to get hot water that I was sure there wasn't any so I called the front desk and they said let it run awhile; I hated wasting so much water to get some hot.  The front desk called two hours later to see if I had gotten hot water - I was asleep"
10,"After a long day, finally reach the hotel to find out reservation was booked for October instead of September 😡. Hotel only had rooms available for one night, so staying there wasn't an option.   Since they messed up, I expected that at least they could offer to help me get a reservation in another hotel and send me there, but on the contrary, at front desk personnel just told me sorry and gave me back my papers.   Should take care of guests, especially when hotel messes up everything!"
40,"This hotel has it all.  Wide range of rooms and amenities based on what you want to pay.  Cheap food in the bar (Strikers) and better ($$$) food in the two restaurants.  Nice pool with a bar outside.  Good exercise/gym room.  Plenty of conventions going on as well as weddings, parties, etc."
40,"I was traveling with a group of friends and we we arrived they were not ready for us. (Hotel Language for- ""we messed up your reservations"". After it was fixed we made it to our room, but the front desk gave two sets of keys to the two different groups, so we had to get it resolved. I thought the front desk would have had it more together. The rooms were USA standard nice in the 3.5 star range. The shuttle left on time for the airport which we appreciated! Not to much to do close by. We only found big chain USA restaurants  to eat at close by."
30,"I had good and bad experience here - the front desk - which is the first impression, I was not impressed.  I asked about access to a balcony and he didn't even look. Was as though I was with a group so they put us all next to each other and there was no discussion of possibly looking at my requirements.  The bed - like others stated was a little hard.  And Very FEW English speaking stations on the TV.  For most other countries you can usually get a handful - I had one that came in only - the other one available was al static.  1 - The coffee was GREAT...  At the buffet. 2 - Room was clean - very comfortable and shower was excellent  All in all I would stay again - but wasn't overly impressed with the service.  Dena"
50,"Comfortable Luxurious  Meticulously clean Attentive service  Good range of amenities  Close to airport and artisan market (both about 10 minutes away by car, traffic permitting) Ground floor featured an American-style sports bar and a Japanese/Sushi restaurant, amongst other offerings"
40,"Stayed at the Barcelo 5-10 September for business. Nice hotel with above average amenities.   To start the day, the hotel has an excellent breakfast. Fresh cut fruit, made to order omelette, and different additional items each day. A friend said the fried bananas were excellent.   The hotel has a large heated pool. It has two gyms; one very small and the other above average for a hotel. Both have basic gym equipment.   The executive lounge on the 9th floor is nice. It has finger food that can make a meal most of the day and drinks after 5:00. It even serves Ron Zacapa, although the servings are heavy on the ice and light on the Zacapa. But, refills, like everything, are free.  All in all, a nice property and a place I definitely intend to visit again. "
50,"I had reservations at a hostel when I went to pick up my daughter in Guatemala, but they didn't have us registered. Soooo we were tired and I just told our driver to take us to a hotel. He was worried that Barceló would be too expensive, but st $116, it was cheaper than the average hotels I stay in for conventions in the States.  The look on my daughter's face when ee walked in was worth every penny. Very luxurious. We will stay there again !"
20,Overpriced for rooms and services provided.   The suites have very dangerous stairs.   The alternatives are not good: Rooms are older and not nice.  Even on executive floor rooms and bathrooms are shabby.  Food passable only.   Would Not recommend or stay there again. Don't Even remember the service.
50,"The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is one of the biggest I've ever seen. The room was very nice, with all the modern amenities. Wifi, minibar, English channels, etc. The sports bar attached to the hotel was very nice, but pretty pricey and the TVs were fuzzy. Small price to pay for a nice hotel though. I'd stay here again."
40,"This hotel have a good location, the rooms are spacious, with balcony and well decorated. Pool area is very good and the service of the lobby bar is professional. Staff are very friendly. Negative: you dont have free wi-fi and if you want is very expensive. The best thing you can do is going to the mc donalds near the hotel because its free."
40,"Hotel meets the needs of business travellers - dinner and breakfast facilities are fine, room and beds are comfortable. Lobby has the ability to conduct a few business meetings quietly and effectively. Pool is large and inviting. Free airport shuttle leaves on the hour - the pick up from the airport is more frequent - suggest you simply advise them which flight you are coming and that helps get on the shuttle from the airport,"
50,I always enjoy my stays at the Barcelo in Guatemala City.  The rooms are spacious and clean with updated decor.  The beds are a little hard for my liking but thay is a matter of opinion.  The pool area is nice with a great jacuzzi and poolside bar.  I highly recommend.
50,We recently stayed for 5 nights at this hotel during our trip to Guatemala. Everyone associated with the hotel was friendly and helpful. The waitresses and waiters and the workers in the shops were so pleasant. The ladies who attended to the hospitality room on the 9th floor were very nice and accommodating. The food in the restaurants was great. We stayed in a mini suite that was comfortable and very clean. The view of the pool and volcanoes was great. The beds were comfortable. There was plenty of bottled water available. I would definitely stay here again. 
40,"Supposedly this hotel is located in a very safe rea. Unfortunately, other tha eating at McDonals's or Subway, there are no restaurants that we felt was safe enough to go to. We ate all our meals at the hotel as our guide kept on telling us how unsafe Guatemala City was."
30,I walked in without a reservation and got a room $45 cheaper than advertised online price. If you like firm mattress you will like Barcelo. I'm not a firm mattress person so it took me quite a bit to fall asleep. Rooms are very clean albeit outdated green carpet. magnificent view of the volcanoes from my room. The buffet breakfast is out of this world! The hotel is very close to the airport.
50,"I was somewhat surprised at the exceptional quality of this hotel compared to the reviews. I wondered if I had been misquoted when I walked in. The staff were the kindest and most polite that we encountered on our trip and the rooms absolutely gorgeous with amazing value. I was dreading the bill but it was as expected and I hadn't bee misquoted it was just great value. In direct contrast to the hotel we had just stayed in.   Exceptional service, beautiful rooms, lovely communal areas. Even the shop was nice. Great service, cleanliness, comfort. They even let my son keep the slippers for free.    For the price you won't be disappointed.   "
50,"I have stayed in this Hotel many times traveling to Guatemala City. The staff are extremely courteous and professional.  The gym ,spa ,pool are very accessible . The Restaurants are great also a sports bar. Great safe location. I would like to thank Melanie in Operations for her professional services. Excellent stay..thanks  "
40,"Not luxury, but very comfortable rooms. Good breakfast, though crowded at times. Helpful stuff. Reasonable price. Fast wifi internet. Useful free shuttle to the airport, which is not far. Local supermarket shop ""La Torre"" nearby, as well as international fast food eateries (McDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC). Located near but not inside the ""Zona viva"" area where hotels catering to international business travelers are concentrated. Streets around kind of empty of pedestrians, maybe a safety concern after dark, though I did not find any problem."
40,"We stayed at the Barcelo on our recent trip to Guatemala.  The hotel is very nice, very clean and the front desk clerks were able to pretty much take care of anything we asked for or about.  Our room was on the 8th floor overlooking the city and close by volcanoes.  That proved cool, as we were able to watch the middle volcano send forth a huge plume of ash and steam the last day that we were there.  The view of the city at night was also nice.  The room had a small lanai with a table and 2 chairs where we often ate breakfast.  We would have enjoyed it more if the traffic hadn't been so heavy and noisy.  (Guatemala drivers seem to really like their horns.)  But it was nice to get the semi-fresh air and breezes that came by. Near the hotel is a McDonald's (if you're into that"
40,"The hotel is centrally located in Zone 9 of the city, a fairly safe area for walking and close to the airport. Very comfortable and large rooms, good breakfast restaurant and a good pub type restaurant which is also frequented by locals. Nice swimming pool and health club. But no free WIFI.   We stayed 3 nights as part of an organized tour of Guatemala."
40,"We stayed here for a total of 3 nights during our time in Guatemala.  We enjoyed our stay and the facilities they have to offer.  The pool was nice and big and heated with plenty of seating around the pool area. They have a nice athletic court where you can play basketball, soccer, and volleyball.  Unfortunately, they charge $3 to use the balls. The gym is open 24-7.  The lobby and decor of the hotel is very nice.  I do agree with some of the others who mentioned a strong perfume smell where the rooms are.  I didn't smell it in our room but the hallways definitely have a strong perfume smell.   Excellent location and very safe.  Close to a grocery store, mall, McDonald's (with Free WiFi), Zoo, shopping, touring, etc."
40,"Stayed here for a week on a work visit. Hotel was in a easy location from the airport, but traffic made distance seem further, with hotel supplied transfers. For a European rooms were of American size with all working parts (and able to open windows for those who dislike Air Con everywhere a bonus). Views from higher floors great across either town or to hills and location close to Reforma provided a safe and easy walking route to town and running option.Excellent pool area to chill out and Gym facilities better than usual. Staff at check-in okay and complimented by friendly and helpful staff in Breakfast area. For me I would have just liked a little more of a local feel rather than an American style hotel transported to Guatemala, but aside from that nothing really to say was"
50,"I stayed here as my first married night in a two floor room, the quality of this place was fabulous i recommend the chocolate cherries and champagne,  The view of Guatemala City and the service was awesome  When visiting Guatemala I definitely recommend this place "
40,"Nice hotel, clean large rooms and friendly staff. Safer neighborhood. Great pool and gym area. Cool view from the 10th floor. Lots of goodies/toiletries in bathroom and nice size shower.  The bed is the only real down side and super disappointing; the bed is like sleeping on bricks or at minimum it feels like only a box spring. "
40,We stayed 2 nights as part of a tour of Guatemala.  the hotel was clean and the staff is friendly with quite a few English speakers.  the wifi is spotty and times with variations in connectivity.  the bathrooms were clean and the rooms quiet.
30,"I visited Guatemala City recently and stayed at the Barcelo. The hotel is not new, but it is very good.  The location is premium. The pool is great. The food could be better, but it is not bad. The only thing I would recommend is to avoid the sport bar food. Really bad food. The maintenance crew is very good and the front desk team is very friendly and helpful.  In overall, I would go back and stay there."
40,Excellent hotel about 15 minutes from the airport. They offer all kinds of rates so the price you pay will depend upon the amenities that you want to have. The pool is a true oasis in the city and the staff are warm and welcoming. They offer a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport and for those of us that failed to learn Spanish prior to your trip will be just fine as everyone speaks English. 
40,the hotel is in a very good and safe section of the city.good breakfast.service is ok. rooms are good. wifi will cost you $10.00 a day for the lobby or in the rooms lobby wifi is good.room wifi is so so.Free shuttle bus to the airport every hour on the top of the hour.Pizza Hut and Macdonald and a convenient store are with in a block.within two blocks a shopping mall with a food court with a variety of foods.Overall a good hotel.
30,The personnel at the front desk were confused. Re asked everything that was on the reservation. They were very slow to process everything. We were overcharged for the room and still have to get that straightened out. The room was OK. The lobby was beautiful and the meal was very good.
20,"While the hotel is beautiful and amenities abundant, the air fresheners in the lobby, hallways and room air conditioning vents is terrible for someone with allergies. There is no reason to use perfume unless they are hiding something. Needed to ask for a room high up so we could open the terrace door to get ""fresh air"". So I had two choices  - breathing exhaust fumes with the terrace door open, or breathe the perfume in the hotel."
40,"Te hotel is well located in the city, the service is pretty good the breakfast buffet too, there is a couple of gyms that are ok not great they lack a couple of gear and the steam bath needs more care, however the beds and pillows are spectacular, got there tired but the sleep was replenishing in the morning each day! Def a must if it fits the budget!"
40,We seem to stay here when our flights are so late! The rooms are very comfortable and roomy. The bed is comfy and plenty of pillows and towels. The breakfast Buffett is really yummy! We sure get a lot of yummy food! The elevators are a little slow but nice. They have lovely gift shop and you can exchange your money in the lobby!  
20,"This hotel is heavily perfumed in the lobby and in the rooms.  It comes out of the air vents. If you have sensitivity to perfumes, do not stay here.  Unfortunately I booked though Hotwire so we are stuck here for 3 more nights. Will be ingesting lots of allergy meds.  Otherwise hotel is ok.  I come to Guatemala City frequently and prefer the Westin or Intercontinental.  They are Much better hotels and location."
30,"It is fair to say that both, service and infrastructure allows a hotel to offer a nice or less nicer experience. This property should have a significant number of years, you can tell this from the decoration style but also from many worn out elements that require renovation. I don't mind old fashioned decoration, but maintenance must be optimal if you don't want to renovate.  The hotel is huge, includes a big lounge bar, three restaurants, a Japanese place which was Ok, a Sports Bar I did not visit, and La Vista restaurant which where breakfast and buffet dinner are served.  Let's start from the good: the gym and pool were nice, the gym is small but serves its purpose, staff is very amiable, probably front desk employees should be friendlier since they are the face of the hotel."
40,"Probably one of the best hotels in CentralAmerica for business trips considering price/quality/service and location. 10 minutes from the airport and close to Zone 10 and other important areas for meetings and business. Excellent Breakfast buffet, effective service and friendly staff.  The pool and gym are fine and there are 2-3 kind of restaurants to choose. The hotel will need investment to review some areas soon."
40,The hotel has an atmosphere of old fashioned grand hotels. Not enough seating by the pool. Could not use it because local families visit it. Internet is not free and high priced. Most new hotels are approx. 300m away - in a fast developing food and entertainment center.
40,"We had a very comfortable stay at Hotel Barcelo.  After a very long day of travel we, we were welcomed by friendly hotel staff.  The bar was very relaxing, a pianist in the background, and a great place to unwind.  The breakfast was absolutely delicious, with made to order omelets and many traditional dishes."
50,"My daughter and I just returned on May 8th from a tour of Guatemala with Caravan tours. This was the first hotel we stayed at and we went down a day ahead, so we were there for 3 nights. It is a beautiful hotel, in a good location and the service was great. We had a free morning before the tour started, so we got a map and walked to the Aurora Zoo....very nice zoo and well kept. We also enjoyed the pool area and hot tub later in the day at the hotel. They have a good buffet as well. The shuttle from the airport was included in my room rate. I would stay there again."
40,"Nice pool, good breakfast, very expensive Japanese restaurant.  Check in and check out not so fast.  Located centrally.   I just stayed there one night on a business trip.  You should try to stay in Antigua if you can!"
20,"Very few people for so many visitors. It seems the don't care about investing on good staff. Food tastes good anyway and the pool is great. Ask for a Zacapa Ron with diet coke on the rocks.  ** Tripadvisor, I don't need to say more, why you need 200 hundred  caracters ???***"
40,"That was for me the best of this hotel. I had breakfast, and it was great, good selection, and well displayed. All employees, but the ones that work at the front desk ( with exception of two, sorry that I did not remember their names) were so friendly. The girls that work at the concierge also fabulous. But the personal that work at the front desk, not that friendly. I work in customer service, and I understand they are tired to deal with customers, or travelers, but they have to remember, that they got paid to do that job.  The internet is not free, but having a McDonalds next to the hotel, at short walking distance is a plus...free Wifi...If I come back to Guatemala City, I will stay in this Hotel.."
30,"The hotel appeared to be a 4 star on the surface, (ie: entrance, lobby, conference rooms) but the sleep rooms were definitely a 2 star. My room needed a definite upgrade in interiors, and the white towels in the bathroom were old, dingy, and tattered on the edges. Luckily I brought my own bath towels. However, the water pressure in the shower was very nice and strong, so be careful if you weight under 120 lbs. The bed was very firm, but should be okay for someone who may prefer firm. Breakfast was included, it too was just okay. If you're staying only one night here it should be fine."
50,"I stayed here three different nights in April during a Gate 1 tour of Guatemala and the Honduras.  After reading some of the reviews here about this hotel, I must say I had a different experience.  Throughout my stay, all staff I encountered were very polite, professional and provided excellent customer service.  Security never ""hounded me"" as some have mentioned.  They were professional and were obviously doing their job to maintain hotel safety.  Not once did one ask me for my key upon entering the hotel.  I got the impression they took visual note of the guests and remembered who was who.  I never heard planes taking off as some have mentioned.  Yes, the hotel is very close to the airport which was very convenient.  During my three night stay, I never thought the rooms were"
30,"Best thing of Barcelo is that is placed 10 minutes away from the airport.  Hotel seems a little old and decoration's quite like old hotels.(I like more modern and contemporary decorations) Service was good. Had no complains.  Food was very good. Each day we had a different menu ( I stayed 4 nights). One day was Spanish festival. This was very good and tasty, with many many variety.  Price was acceptable to good.  "
30,"I have to say My boyfriend and I didn't feel so welcome to this hotel, the man in the counter wasn't very friendly nor helpful and was VERY annoying that the wifi cost 10USD PER day. Breakfast good and varied but expensive compared with other hotels where we asked.  The pool was super crowded during our days in this hotel, so I don't recommend this hotel for holly week.  Good things about the hotel were that the room was perfect: clean, spacious, I loved the bathroom. Also I have to say the hotel is well located close to the Avenue ""la reforma""  where you can walk or do sport. This avenue  I would say is one of the best I have seen. The hotel has spa, steam bath and jacuzzi ...which I heard that is a kind of Private ""Club "", hence you will find persons staying at the hotel and"
40,We stayed here on our way to Tikal...The hotel includes a very good breakfast with a great variety of food.They have the Hertz rental office in the lobby of the hotel which makes it very convenient.They also offer free shuttle to the airport.The rooms are clean and the hotel is well kept.
50,"Stayed here in October 2014, so a little late in the coming!  Nice room, even nicer bed! Great food all the time! Superfast lifts!  What's really best - i dropped my passport and realised it a bit later and didn't really know where i dropped it. The reception tried all options and then we left a message with Lost & found. After some time, i get a call! we found your passport! i had dropped it in the corridor and a housekeeping staff found it and gave it to the lost & found for safe keeping! awsum feeling when i got it back and great help from the staff!"
30,"This hotel was just ok.  The common areas are beautiful but the rooms are just standard.  The breakfast buffet was delicious with so many selections.  But what made this just ok was the staff.  They were not friendly or helpful at all.  That is with the exception of the gentlemen in the business center who assisted me with a phone call. I also thought it was ridiculous that they charged for wi-fi.  We stayed in 2 different hotels in Antigua and had free wi-fi, even in our rooms.  We also stayed in a hotel in Chichicastenango and had free wi-fi in the common areas, which included the courtyard outside our room."
40,"After spending 6 days resting, walking, testing my new knee,it was time for this senior to go home.  Alfredo, of Alf Transportation , picked me up in Panajachel and we headed to Guatemala City for a two night stay.  Barcelo is a high rise hotel with many rooms.  My room was large, air conditioned, some English tv, hot water, nice amenities.  When I called down for another blanket it was immediately delivered. There are two entrances/exits, each has a staff member there. The elevator needs your room key passed over it in order to go up.  I felt very safe even though I was alone. Breakfast was excellent, whatever you want to eat is there to will be made for you. Around the corner of the hotel , no street crossing, is a McDonalds, good for a coffee or soda, yogurt,etc. The next day"
40,"We just returned from Guatemala.  We spent several days staying at The Barcelo in Guatemala City.  The hotel is great - location is perfect to find restaurants that are safe to walk to.  On our first few nights we had a view of the volcano on the street side and on the last night we had a larger, brighter room that overlooked the pool.  (Ask for this on the Maya side).  We had a great breakfast included in our rate and made use of the pool and fitness center.  Guatemala is a large city and this resort is a little oasis in the middle of it all - Another great feature is it is close to the airport and has a free shuttle service.  Great value."
40,Barcelo was a fine basecamp for us. Easy shuttle to and from the airport and just a few easy blocks from downtowns great food scene. I recommend getting out and checking out that part of town. The staff was accommodating to me and the hotel was very comfortable. I had a patio which was very nice to sit and do a little work. Wifi was strong and there are a few restaurants in the hotel that are fine for a quick bite or drink. I'd stay here again.
20,"We have stayed at this hotel many times: probably at least 6 as a Marriott and now twice as Barcelo. Although the pool and rooms are relatively nice, it is completely lacking in charm and we were frustrated with poor service last week. We tried to talk to both the restaurant staff and the general manager about a way to reserve a small space for a special family reunion. Not only were they unwilling to let us reserve tables or patio space, they were offensive in the way they stated that our guests would need to register and show picture ID just to sit in the hotel and visit with us. It smacked of prejudice and snobbery and we went elsewhere to spend our food dollars. Very disappointing stay."
20,"We stayed there last April and the hotel was very nice (not perfect).  What made it nice was the service was wonderful, as you would expect for the price.  It is safe and convenient to the airport.  This year, every time we had a question or wanted to ask for something, the answer was no or nothing.  Since this was a family vacation and we have family in Guatemala, this made all the details complicated.  For example, we paid for breakfast being included, and one day this included our 6-year-old son, and the next day we had to pay extra for him.  (The breakfast is really wonderful!!! so not having it clearly part of our package we paid for was complicated because we really didn't want to have to bargain or argue over this or have inconsistencies after having paid for it.)   Also,"
30,"The Barcelo is a nice hotel but way overpriced. I stayed there twice, once at the beginning of my trip and then again at the end because it is close to the airport and they do have a free shuttle. The room was disappointing. It was no better than a standard priced U.S. chain hotel. My first visit, I was charged $10.00 a day for WiFi, which was free my second visit. No meals were included in the price of the room. I just felt I was being nickled and dimed to death for everything. The staff while helpful and courteous, was not very friendly. Next time I visit Guatemala City I will be staying elsewhere."
50,Humanitarian aid brings me to Guatemala and this hotel has been my last stop before returning home. Breakfast is wonderfully excessive with a buffet complete with a omelette chef. Beds are a dream. Close to airport with shuttle.
30,"We made a reservation for 5 nights here and paid ahead because it was a special promotion. Loved the hotel location, safe neighborhood, nice surroundings. The hotel itself was pretty modern, well kept and staff was friendly. Several restaurant options which was a life saver for us as we had booked daily tours and came back very tired most of the nights so eating in was our first choice. Only issue was, I was covered in bug bites. At first i thought it might have been from one of our tours, so I bought repellent. Last night I noticed I felt a bite while in bed. We checked and yeap.... bed bugs. I felt pretty stupid not noticing it before."
40,"Our party of 12 people shared 4 total rooms.  None of us were disappointed with the rooms, service or amenities.  The staff is very professional and kind.  They have a free shuttle to the airport.  We did not eat in the restaurants because the prices seemed a bit steep ($15 USD for an omelette) but, you can safely walk to many restaurants in the area.    Ask for a balcony room over the pool area.  This will keep you away from the noise of the airplanes coming and going."
40,"I've stayed in this hotel a few times and they always deliver a good service and friendly staff. This time we didn't have breakfast but they offer coffee, yogurt, bread and some fruit since 5am (buffet starts at 6 I believe).   They are conveniently located very close to the airport (for those who flight very early this hotel is less than 10 minutes away from the airport -without traffic 5am). If you need transportation very early make sure to book it the night before since they don't always have a cap on duty.    The price for what you get (great service from a major hotel franchise) is great too!  I would stay more often here if they'd have a loyalty program or at least let the guest to earn miles from airline programs (they only have it with Iberia - not attractive for those"
40,"A top Hotel near the airport. Rooms were very nice. The Buffet breakfast was very good. The staff was very helpful (they found my lost lens cap for my Sony camera). It's classy, and reasonably priced for the product. Wifi for 24 hrs costs $10 US (2 devices). Note, give Guatemala 10 more years, and hotel wifi will be free as it is most everywhere else.  There is a grocery/liquor store behind the hotel if you want - as your looking at the front entrance - go to the street on your right, turn toward where the back of the hotel would be, go to the end of the block, and to your right (across the street) is a good grocery/liquor store. They even had Zacapa Rum. The street is very safe and well lit."
50,"After a long day of travel, it was wonderful to check into this hotel and find everything in place, clean and comfortable.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is very beautiful and calm.  Just what I needed!"
50,"I really enjoyed my stay here. From the gracious and attentive service to the pool and poolside bar, the location, beautiful room with balcony and views. Everything. I would stay here again in a minute."
50,"Staying at the Barcelo was a great experience.  The hotel is spacious and the display of flowers is just breath taking.  Not enough can be said about the wonderful buffet served daily; it is extremely large with a huge selection of ethnic food. The display of paintings throughout the hotel catches ones attention.  A unique experience is the sight of the planes taking off from the nearby airport. It seems you can almost reach out and touch them as they fly by.. Then, too, there is a fantastic view of the volcanoes from the front balconies where you can sit, relax and enjoy refreshments I will be returning for my 4th trip this fall."
20,"The hotel in general is good, old, but good. Has very good restaurants, rooms are large and clean, bathroom could use an update, but nothing wrong. There are three things that made this stay be ""poor"":  1) The Gym located in the lobby called ""GUEST GYM"" is probably the worst gym I have seen in any Central American hotel. The machines are falling appart, no A/C... simply bad. Another guest told me there was another Gym I could use in the pool area but I could not find it.   2) Shuttle Service. This hotel (and many other in Guatemala) brag about a free shuttle service. When the plane landed a few of us where looking for the Barcelo Shuttle. When we found it, the driver in the most despreciative way told us that he was waiting for the UNITED AIRLINES crew to arrive and that we"
40,"This hotel is located very near the airport and is thus convenient for arriving and departing.  I guess that is why Caravan Tours uses it.  The food is good with a nice breakfast buffet.  The pool is warm and large and acceptable for lap swimming. The rooms are clean and comfortable and all the amenities are present.   The hotel would have earned my last star if the neighborhood were more appealing.  There is a most convenient supermarket around the corner, but walking for sights and culture is not on the menu.  I had to walk next door to the McDonalds to use their free wi-fi."
40,"Pros: Ample, comfortable rooms Courteous, helpful staff  Within walking distance to restaurants Good wi-fi in rooms Cons: Parking lot behind hotel pretty crowded Rooms need updating/upkeep (see curtain photo) At times the hotel feels like a locked down facility, security guards all over the place, sometimes one or more armed guards (with rifles) at the main gate, I was taking pictures of the buildings behind the hotel from the parking lot and security told me I couldn't take pictures because this was a private property, they radioed their supervisor who I had to remind I was a guest and he apologized"
50,"Just a few minutes from the airport with phenomenal accommodations, service and great views of the volcanoes and the inner city.   The service staff were amazing and we definitely enjoyed the food, room and service.  We will definitely book future trips at the Barcelo. They resort is legacy minded about making a difference for those who are vulnerable. Their legacy will truly be service. "
40,"The Barcelo is a reliable, functional, business-oriented hotel not far (a short taxi ride) away from Guatemala City airport. Although suitable for business travellers, families with children or tourists need not feel left out. Our room, on the 7th floor, was spacious and comfortable and had everything that the average upmarket modern hotel room should contain. The bed was very large and comfortable, with a plethora of pillows. The bathroom was convenient and well-appointed. You could see the aircraft flying low towards the nearby airport, but noise was at a minimum.  The hotel has a swimming pool, and a small fitness centre with some weights machines and exercise bikes etc.  There was a large breakfast buffet with some Guatemalan specialities and plenty of choice of other"
20,"Expensive hotel for what it has to offer. Trying to be premium but not really walking the talk. The building and interior is way too old, the service is not that great. My bed reminded me of a surgical bed and there was no way to drain the water from the sink of bath tub in the bathroom!!!  I was actually going to give a single star rating but was positively surprised by the breakfast which was quite good."
50,"The Barcelo is not as new and elaborate as some of the newest high end hotels in this city, but it is pleasant, clean, well-staffed and well located. It has a large outdoor pool and spa, three restaurants, a bar, gift shops and exercise room. The rooms are large. Ours was a corner room with two balconies. They provide bathrobes and slippers and free water for the coffee maker. The breakfast buffet is extensive and well-stocked, and may of the items change each day. The wi-fi seems to work well in any area of the property."
50,"We stayed 3 separate nights at the Barcelo Guatemala City and the last one, in the older section, was the best.  The newer section has glass doors on the shower and a ""rainfall"" shower which was impossible to get in and out of without totally wetting your hair and the floor. (they did provide a shower cap, which I discovered in time for the 2nd stay). The older section had a shower curtain and a regular shower head that was adjustable - so no wet hair nor floor!  The employees of the Barcelo are marvelous and most speak English.  There is an American-type sports bar ""Kickers"" which has burgers and fries if you feel the need.  There is also a restaurant with an extensive and reasonably priced breakfast - try the plantains - delicious!  Although we didn't use it, WIFI is available"
20,"Even though it is at a great location, this hotel needs an major update. Please DO NOT agree with their ""upgrade to a suite"". Their suites are two floor rooms, with a spiral case, bed on the upper floor; if you go for business you know how impractical this can be.  Going up and down, etc - but the worst part was that during my dinner meeting, my client decides to order from their ""Japanese restaurant""...bad idea...I got food poisoning, was sick all night. The next morning I told the check out person, but he only asked me if I called the front desk, I told him I didn't because I was very sick (and also, I just realized later on, that there was a phone in the bathroom!, other phone is in the lower floor not next to bed as other hotels). That's it. No more follow ups or ""let me"
50,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed here & love the proximity to the airport.  After living a little rough for two weeks we were very pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded to an 11th floor suite.  Even without that perk, we will be staying here again on our next visit. The staff is very pleasant.  We ate in the sports bar & the prices are a little steep compared to places out of the city but it could be worse. There are a lot of tour/church groups.  However, I can't imagine any reason to stay in the city longer than 1 night so this shouldn't be a factor in choosing this hotel. There are 2 gift shops & the one closest to the pool area has the best prices."
40,Although I have been to Guatemala City numerous times I had never stayed in the Barcelo.  The hotel is located on walking distance of the Zona 10 where more hotels and restaurants are located.  The indoor of the hotel is very nice (from lobby to rooms) and well maintained. Service at reception is good and the rooms are well equipped.  There is a nice bar in the lobby which has live music in the evening.  The hotel itself has several restaurants but with the Zona 10 on the other side of the road you can also opt for one of the restaurants in that area.  In the morning there is a buffet style breakfast which is included in the price.  Wifi is OK (speed and quality differs) and included in the price.  All together a good place to stay for a business traveller.
40,Central location Well run hotel Buffet excellent with plenty of food choices and fresh juices Service good Sadly only 1 bottle of water provided in room for 2 people Tap water not recommended for brushing teeth
40,"I stayed recently for 3 nights and was not disappointed with the well-appointed staff, the cleanliness of the room, lobby, and all other areas of the hotel, and the overall quiet stay. My buffet breakfast was included. One morning it was served in the Stryker's Restaurant, the other mornings in one of the meeting rooms. There were many fresh choices. The bed in my room was a bit hard but I had no difficulties sleeping. My wi-fi was not free - as it should be for a predominantly business hotel - which was a tremendous disappointment. Very close to the airport but not so that airplanes were flying overhead. I would stay here again."
50,"It is a very comfortable hotel,perfect for bussiness travels, since it is located in the center of the city, it makes a secure place. You can walk to the rose zone in groups, and there you can find good places to eat and also have fun.   The hotel also have comfortable rooms, the attention is good, they have a good wifi speed.   The food is fine, too.   I really highly recommend this hotel."
50,"First class luxury Hotel, secure, Restaurants on site, Convenient to Airport, hourly shuttles Our only regret was that an early flight did not allow us to enjoy the luxury a little longer Multilingual staff I asked at the desk for another bottle of water and it was simply delivered to my room and was waiting for me when I returned"
20,We reserved the Barceló hotel through Expedia and found out when we got there we had to pay extra for wifi and many other services. The staff was not very nice and at times arrogant. I will not stay there again and recommend to all to find another place.
50,"my husband and I just came back from a trip to Guatemala and decided to stay @ Barcelo hotel. What a great place to stay for 2 nights. Our room on 5th floor was really nice, very clean, well decorated, all we needed was furnished included quality toiletries frm Italy. But what was truly amazing to us was the fabulous breakfast buffet with an amazing selection of dishes, from eggs Florentine, my favorite! to black beans Guatemalan style, to at least 5 selection of fresh juice to include papaya, sandia, melon, all delicious! You really did not have to have lunch after eaten breakfast there. Their facilities are great, excellent SPA and massage services, $45.00 for an hr massage. We also enjoyed shopping at their little souvenir store at the hotel, found cute things and at a good"
40,"The Barcelo is super close to the airport so it's very convenient for late/early flights. The restaurant was decent with a wide buffet selection. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The bed in my opinion was a little too hard to sleep on. This said I would probably return based on its proximity to the airport. Also, the zone the hotel is in is relatively safe which is good."
50,This hotel has lots of accommodations to include several restaurants and shops. Has a swimming pool and exercise room as well. The rooms are great and great furniture. The tub drained very slowly so it was kind of like taking a bath and shower at the same time. But everything else was great.
40,"We had two overnight stays at Barcelona during our visit to Guatemala. The hotel is very large and looks to cater very well for business trips but does just as well for leisure. The rooms were spacious, very well appointed, clean and modern. There is an American type bar/restaurant in the hotel which serves tasty food. We left very early on both occasions so can't comment on breakfast but assume they do a good job of that too."
40,We were on the 9th floor. You needed a room key to use the elevator but one of ours didn't work. needed more instruction. guards were all over the busy lobby Room was large; bathroom clean and safe. The safe was hard to reach under the nightstand Sheets were changed every day.
30,"The room was cold. I tried for heat, no dice. I asked for blankets for myself and 2 others in my party. I was told they might not be available.  Was told after an 8 minute wait that only 2=were available. Had to wait for them at the desk  the buffet is way less than in years past as well.   Really disappointed  I will think long and hard before booking here again. There was a party in the ballroom/meeting section of the hotel across the courtyard and the music was quite audible"
40,"We stayed 3 nights. We were with Caravan tours. The hotel, rooms and pool area are lovely. The water is purified, so no concerns there. Nice bar area. At least three different options for dining. Very attentive staff. WiFi is not free."
50,"We stayed in a superior room for seven nights.  The room was clean, spacious and comfortable.  The buffet breakfast features a wide variety of Guatemalan and international food.  We appreciated the hotel's shuttle service to and from the airport, which is only 5-10 minutes from the hotel.  The hotel has an excellent gym which is available to all guests.  The Barceló is located a long block away from the Zona 10, which has many restaurants and at least two nearby malls (Geminis 10 and Próceres)."
50,"Close to airport, clean and quiet room. As the hotel was full we were upgraded to a two-story suite. Divine! Breakfast was included and the buffet was sumptuous. Would definitely stay here again. Great view of the volcano from the room!"
40,"Great location near the airport.   High end conference center, beautiful lobby and public spaces.  Lots of traveler support - ATM's, Airline Desks (American for sure - and I think Delta)  Ten minutes from Guatemala City Airport.  Walking distance from a grocery store (think big 7/11) ask for directions - but not at night!  Rooms are very nice - no problems - and well appointed.  Service was good in all areas.  My only gripe was $15 per day for wifi internet - pretty old fashioned....   But that is what the Barceló is - a Mid town - high class - very nice, old fashioned hotel.  I would return.  - so for $15 - pay, forget, and enjoy!!!!!  Hasta la vista."
50,"The room was fine and as expected.  But everything else was just wonderful!  The hotel was so close to the airport but not noisy.  The breakfast was in a very cosy nicely appointed restaurant and had everything to offer that you could think of.  The service was friendly.  We were pointed in the direction of the business centre for information and were given recommendations for a fabulous walking tour of the area!  Outstanding.  I was very impressed.  Of course, it also helped the mood that hundreds of red pointsettias decorated the lobby to add that special touch.  As the photos show, an entire fitness centre is attached to the hotel!  What more could you ask for."
50,"I've been coming here for the past four years now and love it here!  The hotel has a really nice appearance.  It has several restaurants inside.  You can eat a buffet at one of the restaurants for breakfast and it is AMAZING!  I love the food there!  It tastes so good, there's so much variety, and the eye appeal is perfect!  There is a very nice pool and pool area here as well.  The staff is friendly.  And everytime I have been, they have made a huge design on the floor at the entry with very vibrant colors that is made completely out of some sort of powder.  The price is very reasonable.  I will continue to stay here every time I need a hotel in Guatemala City!"
40,Large hotel very convenient for airport. Very well appointed and exceptionally comfortable. Slightly spoiled by somewhat slow check in. Large room with balcony overlooking the city. Excellent breakfast.
20,"Arrived late with only one person at the front desk.  Not a good time to wait in line and there were two people in front of us at this late hour.     Got to room to find two double beds instead of King.  Too late to bother to change for a one night stay.  Bathroom sink and tub did not drain properly and hair dryer did not work.  For this type of hotel, I was very disappointed.     Workout room was open early so got to take advantage of that but the machines did not all work properly and the one workout mat I could find looked very well used.   I expected more from this hotel but I was on a packaged group tour and had no choice."
40,"Having booked a few months in advance we got a room for US$75 for the night. Wifi is extra but works well throughout the hotel. We used the pool, steam room and sauna. Breakfast was a buffet. As we had a morning flight we were early but the room was still pretty busy but enough time to get a fair feed. There's a range of fresh fruit, cheese, cold meats, omelettes to preference, very crispy bacon and local sausages. A free bus takes you to the airport on the hour. We had dinner at 160Q per person for a buffet of ""international"" foods. As one would expect, Alcohol is a ridiculous price. We did look up to see if the chain has other hotel deals on our trip but without success. Visit the shop too as the lady chases you around the place trying to sell everything."
50,"We had luxury accommodations including a balcony with great view of the volcanoes.  The breakfast buffet has a huge variety of well prepared food. The staff, especially at the business office, was very helpful arranging for cabs and tours. All for about $85. 00 a day. As for the $10.00 internet charge (a management mistake in my estimation), we just went to next door to McDonalds they have free internet and a McCafe."
40,"Good hotel, well-situated in city.  Clean, excellent food.  Staff was inconsistent.   Great for event staff and business center staff (especially Astrid ) were incredibly helpful,  despite limited resources.   Reception staff less than expected.   Rooms nice, and for once, had sufficient outlets (always a problem when traveling ).  I would definitely recommend for business. "
50,"Stayed three nights as part of a Gate 1 package.  Staff all speaks English. Upon arrival, our room was not ready so we headed over to the sports bar and had a beer.  Several other tables occupied by fellow gringo's from U.S.  Friendly bartender and staff.  Wondered around main floor.  Several nice gift shops, main dining room, and sushi restaurant, business center with plenty of pc's, travel agency, etc.  Didn't see the gym or pool.  Room the first night was a corner room on 8th floor with view of Volcanoes and part of the city.  Beautiful and breezy.  No need for air conditioning.  Dining room had a lovely seafood buffet set up that night, so we stayed in for dinner. They also have an unbelievably awesome breakfast buffet!  Upon returning from Chichicastenango, the last two"
40,"Spent three nights here & this is a nice hotel with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Seems safe for walking in the immediate area. Only 10 minutes to the airport. However in the days of free wifi in most hotels, restaurants & some airports they still charge $10.00 per day. "
10,"Well first the good. Nice hotel 'looks' clean. Nice  front desk.   Now if you like to be late outside of hotel be carefull you might find yourself arguing to get to your room. Hotel lock down at 1130 pm. or so they say.  I felt like i was either a thief or the president to many guards in premises.  Also the worst found roaches in my room.  And to top it all of room service is the worst.  You have a room service menu that stated 24 hours but when i call to get a night snack (ice cream) at 11:20 pm they tell me the dont have it.  so i hang up and call again maybe i misunderstood, but no. they did have ice cream but since it was past 11 pm no ice cream for me. the weird thing is that menu state 11 hours to 24 hours. My wife call to argue and finally after one hour got my ice cream."
40,"Nice hotel near Zona viva, you can go walking in 5 minutes with no problems. Is a good area and there are no people who bother you. The rooms are nice, even if I don't like carpets. Led TV, you can ask for the key of the frigobar. Good shower with power and all the things that you need. The buffet in the morning is really good with lots of fresh fruit. The hotel has different restaurants but I didn't try as the re were nice placer near about. There are two travel agencies if you wish to have a tour, one is hidden behind the entrance and one is in the hall. WiFi is good. Nice swimmingpool with jacuzzi open till night. "
50,Our room has a balcony with a great view of the volcano.  The hotel staff was helpful and friendly. Our room was clean and spacious. The restaurant offers great food. Great hotel pool with life guard.  Hotel has several shops for souvenirs and for basic necessities.
20,"Booked through booking.com and the hotel didn't want to provide me with WIFI because they said I didn't book the hotel directly with them, therefore, they charged me $10 for Internet services.  They don't really care about taking care of their clients! Will not stay here again."
40,"Very clean and nice hotel the food and restaurant are good. Great pool area. The only negative thing for me was playing some card games with friends at night in lobby, (no money involve) some kids game and laughing, the security said card game prohibited in the hotel. But very nice crew and employee all over the hotel. "
50,"I really like this hotel, located in the safest part of the city, and only a short drive from the airport  The rooms are equipped with lots of amenities, flat-screen TV, robe and slippers.  It has a nice, heated pool and jacuzzi, and a gym.  The beautiful lobby has a pianist playing a grand piano in the lobby in the evenings.  The personnel were friendly and helpful.  The food I had was excellent, especially prepared for passengers on our Caravan Tour.  There is an AATM in the lobby."
30,"We stayed here 3 nights over 10 days in January. It has many nice attributes and a couple of drawbacks. It is a really nice, clean and apparently well run hotel. Our rooms were quite nice-comparable to an average Hilton in the US. The public areas were very nice as were the pool and exercise room. There are some nice shops and restaurants in the lobby. It is very close to the airport which is a curse and a blessing. depending on your purpose for staying there. We were on vacation so the very loud noise of airplanes going (barely) over the top of the hotel was unnerving and did not make sleeping easy. The location is also a long way from any attractions except the zoo. There is a small grocery store a block from the hotel which was handy for bottled water and snacks. There is a"
40,I don't think you will find a better hotel in Guatemala City. It's basically an American hotel with modern amenities. The hotel is minutes from the airport and centrally located. Good pool and semi warm hot tub :) great hotel and very comfortable. 
30,"A soulless place that put us in a double when we'd booked a suite.  On the upside, there seemed to be security guys everywhere, and the breakfast buffet was fabulous.  Late night staff not very helpful, day/AM staff great."
50,"Was only at Barcelo Guatemala City for one night, but was quite impressed with the hotel and staff.  Our flight was delayed numerous hours getting in quite late and they still had a driver at the airport to pick us up which was much appreciated.  Room was nice and comfy. Would stay here again."
30,"This hotel has the basics right, the rooms, whilst older looking, are in very good condition and were extremely clean, and the beds super comfortable.  The pool and gym is also very good.  What is lacking is atmosphere in the large lobby, it felt dark and dead.  The staff were also very lax in their service, the hotel seemed a little quiet so we encountered a lot of staff standing around looking disinterested and unwilling to interact with guests.  When I asked for a map at the front desk, I was sent to the business centre, where a poorly photocopied map showing two museums on it was presented to me.  I ate in the sports bar 2 nights, and the food was below average in quality.  I am sure there are much better hotels in Guatemala City."
50,"Beautiful space, and very efficient to use near the airport.  The shuttle was waiting (actually 2) with the others for the Westin and Intercontinental outside the airport door.  I had an early flight out the next day, and wakeup call was on time, as was the hourly shuttle.  They couldn't have made my layover any easier."
40,"The Barcelos are usually a good bet, and this was no exception. Room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. Nice breakfast, good wifi. There are a number of restaurants in the hotel, a good option after a long work day. The desk staff were friendly, and the free shuttle to the airport was a nice plus. I will stay here again most likely on my next visit to Guatemala City."
50,Reserved 2 rooms they were so spacious !! One of the suites was amazing with a wonderful view of the city and a near by Vocano. This is where we started our journey I absolutely loved it from the excercise classes to the spa ( a bit different for me but it was nice ) and the staff always so attentive. WI definitely go back next time I am in Guatemala city.
50,We stayed 2 nights at this hotel which is located in the well established part of the city. We were amazed the selections at the breakfast buffet. Very friendly and professional staff. The hotel is attached to the gym and spa. The pool is great size and heated. Our room was spacious and kept well. We missed the fridge but coffee machine and complimentary coffee and tea were available. 
40,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our tour with Gate 1. We arrived pretty late the first night and check in was a breeze. The room was plenty spacious, even if the bed was a bit on the hard side. My husband really enjoyed being able to have pico de gallo, guacamole, and fajitas for breakfast! On our return from Chichi, the room we were given had a distinct smoke smell. We had to keep the fan running and the sliding door open to air it out. The hotel was in a great location for restaurants and some shopping."
50,"We get our room as soon as we arrived even we were early. After 27 hours travelling, that was really great. Also the free transportation from airport was nice. Breakfast service was excellent too. Location of the hotel was perfect, near shopping centres."
10,"Don't let the little boxes of toiletries professing to be Italian fool you; this hotel pretends to be a lot nicer than it is. To start with, there were several dirty surfaces in the rooms, the toilet leaked onto the floor, and the sink didn't drain well. Their ultra high-flow showers are not only environmentally irresponsible, but overwhelming, like trying to bathe in a waterfall. I gave up messing around with pressure and heat very quickly. The hair dryer was I'm pretty sure older than I am (28) and had two settings: human baby breath and wind from hell, complete with burning smell.  Then there's the food: seriously terrible for vegetarians. And in a twilight zone attempting to be an American sports bar, down to the peanuts. We had much better food in the middle of nowhere in"
50,I have stayed here with family and with groups and have alway had excellent service! An outstanding breakfast bar is included with your room! Swimming pool and hot tub is a wonderful way to relax after a day of travel! Comfortable beds and spacious rooms.
50,"I stayed at the hotel for three days at the start and end of a  Caravan bus tour of Guatemala. I had a large rooms thru out our stay with two double beds and ample space to store our bags and clothing with out crowding.  The bathroom  was of good size and stocked with a huge assortment of soap, shampoos, shower caps and other items provided for our use. We had thee american tv stations and the BBC, along with 50+ Spanish speaking channels, some with English subtitles.  We were provided with wonderful beds, and many assorted pillows of different size and shapes and stuffing material, bottle water, coffee maker and coffee, and best of all quite rooms and hallways with provided wonderful  sleep each night.  Thru out our stay the wait staff, desk and maid service was timely,"
50,"Your typical top of the line, fully westernized experience. The best breakfast buffet in town, comfortable beds, clean rooms, gym, spa, shopping, nice bar, restaurants. Close to shopping stores and restaurants, and very close to the airport. Fairly quiet, as far as the jet noise.No complaints."
40,"Immaculate and comfortable room in the upscale hotel section of town. But amazingly the wifi is not free, in this day and age where even the cheapest hostels have free wifi. Breakfast is also not provided. The area around the hotel has several American fast food restaurants, but other than that nothing much. Hotel is close to airport, national museum, and zoo. The free airport shuttle is nice."
50,"I stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City in early December 2015.  The Hotel is just outside what is called La Zona Viva (nightlife zone); but close enough (crossing La Reforma Avenue).  The airport is less than 4 km away. The Hotel has a long tradition of excellence in Guatemala, through different names, but always providing high quality service. Room (2 double beds) was very confortable and spacious. Bathroom was good in size and amenities (shampoo, conditioner and bath gel dispensers in the shower/bathtub). TV channels with poor quality (supposed to be cable TV).  Coffee maker available with complimentary bottle of water. Beds are very confortable, plenty of choices for your pillow.  After a long transatlantic flight with several hours delay; such a nice bed was something to be"
40,"This hotel is located a very short shuttle ride (complimentary) from the airport and, therefore, quite near to the Aurora Zoo.  I was warmly welcomed at the front desk and in the Sports Bar on the day of my arrival and then again at breakfast in the morning.  The hotel is very clean and the service is good.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed. The buffet breakfast in the morning is very nice, featuring everything from fresh fruit and yoghurt to omelets cooked to order.   The entire property feels quite secure.  There is a spa onsite as well as several restaurants.  I would defiitely recommedd this hotel for both business and pleasure travelers.  It is a great value for the money."
50,"I have stayed in this hotel several times. It is clean, spacious and the staff is very professional. Nice restaurant and the breakfast buffet is one of the best ever had. The bed was comfortable and nice covers. Internet works fine. "
50,"I stayed at the Barcelo with a Gate 1 Tour, which is managed in Guatemala by Clark Tours, a reliable, well established local agency.    The Barcelo is 5 minutes from La Aurora Airport, is spacious and has most every conceivable service.  If you want a quiet room, ask for a higher floor, as there is music and nightlife, particularly on weekends. Non smoking rooms available on request.  This former Marriot is a very clean, modern hotel, fine service, quick check in and check out, excellent room with good bed, mattress and soft pillows, A/C, television, safe, good water pressure in shower, with an extensive assortment of toiletries and amenities in the room, also a fine (included) buffet breakfast.  WiFi is available for $10/day (for up to 2 devices).    I did not visit the"
50,"The staff at hotel barcelo are true professionals, they are legitimate concern about customer satisfaction and strive every day to offer the best service possible.  The rooms are always clean, and nicely decorated. The food is just great, breakfast is my favorite at this hotel. They have 3 restaurants on site; and the Japanese restaurant is by far the BEST IN TOWN. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Guatemala."
50,Very nice Hotel close to the airport at a very good price. We stayed only one night in a two level suite at the top floor. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a restaurant with live music that we enjoyed for the night
50,"This was a first class, more modern hotel, close to the airport, with multiple dining options, and within walking distance of a Starbucks (apparently new to the area).  You can even get $$ exchanged for Quetzales at the front desk! As we found with all Guatemalans, the staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful."
30,"Check in took about 30 minutes long lines . Typical city business hotel. Lots of unnecessary things in the rooms a plate of little cakes which we did not eat , shoe horn, comb etc. Soap ,shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower but the lids did not lock so anyone could have added anything. Excellent breakfast. Fast checkout at 8 am."
50,"I stayed at this place a few nights, everything you needed and great view of city at night. Live music, shots,and lovely employees. Didn't need to leave unless I wanted to. Pool,Jacuzzi well protected from outsiders. "
40,"I liked almost everything about the Hotel Barceló with perhaps one or two minor exceptions. The location is convenient to the central area and just a short ride by the hotel's free shuttle to La Aurora International Airport. During my two-night stay, I found the entire hotel staff – front desk, housekeeping, security, restaurant, and business center -- to be friendly and helpful. The guest rooms were modern and well-equipped, and the La Vista restaurant was exceptional. It was also nice to have a United Airlines city ticket office on the premises, where I was able to quickly change a reservation and get new boarding passes.  My large fourth-floor room at the Barceló included a private balcony and an excellent city view, three telephones including one in the bathroom, an in-room"
10,"Came to Guatemala for a family wedding and this hotel was a horrible experience. My family had reservations for 2 rooms here and we checked in late to our rooms on 11/12/15. No joke, we seriously could've died here! They run their mini bar with ammonia gas? They do not have any detectors for toxic gases! Yea, completely unacceptable. Me, my mom, mother in law and my 1 year old daughter were supposed to be sleeping and I noticed a very strong and unpleasant smell in the room. Luckily, we didn't go to sleep right away and we went over to our other family's room to plan out our itinerary the next days in Guatemala. My mom stayed behind in the room and she was already dosing off in bed. I noticed that smell in the room was stronger as I returned to the room. I called my other family"
50,"This is a deluxe hotel, very close to Guatemala City Airport.  The shuttle van was waiting for us, we had a quick check-in with courteous hotel staff.  Wonderful buffet breakfast the next morning.   Perfect place for overnight accommodations (or longer) in Guatemala City,"
40,"I had to got to stay at the Barcelo last month. We stayed in the concierge levels and had a 2 floor suite. A VERY nice room. Super clean, and comfortable. The maid even folded our clothes when we didn't have time to take them off of the bed. The bathrooms were very clean and had generous amounts of shampoo and 'stuff'. I really have no complaints although I was traveling with my 8 year old daughter and she was not allowed in the executive lounge and the food in the hotel restaurant was not conducive for a child, but we made due and would stay there again for sure. I highly recommend."
50,"I went to Guatemala on a mission trip and this was our last night before flying back to the USA. We had been staying in a very primitive hotel in Rabinal so this was a huge upgrade. The room was a great size, there was all sorts of giveaway items in the bathroom, and we had a patio to look out over the city. I also ate in the sports bar downstairs and the staff there was friendly and the food was good. The breakfast bar in the morning was simply amazing, so many choices!!! "
50,"Very nice hotel at a good location. Room clean, comfortable and well furnished. Good view of the city. Buffet food was excellent, even stir fry to your order. The drawback of being close to the airport is the airplane noise but be minimized by closing the sliding door."
40,We stayed 2x at this hotel when we entered and left our tour with Caravan Tours.  Its in a handy location to the airport and provides hourly shuttles.  Our meals were excellent at the hotel and ditto the rooms comfortable.  If visiting Guatemala City we would definitely stay here again.
50,"The room was clean, comfortable and best of all, affordable.  The breakfast bar was amazing and was included in the price of the room.  Don't miss breakfast!  The location was perfect for our group since it was so close to the airport.  I recommend it highly!"
50,"A very lovely hotel and a great hotel.  The rooms had a lovely view of the city. The room was clean.  Although I was only there for an overnight, the hotel has a lovely large outside pool and hot tub. I was able to get to the airport with great ease through the hotel's early morning shuttle. I would highly recommend this hotel."
50,"We stayed here with a family of 4.  The hotel was clean and comfortable and conveniently located.  We booked about 2 months in advance and got a really good deal.  We paid less than $100 per night for a room with a terrace with wifi and breakfast buffet.   The breakfast buffet was gigantic and delicious, even having cooked to order omlettes.  Noise was not an issue and service was generally good.    Only the issue we had was pool bar service was very poor.  One time we actually left because no one came, even after the lifeguard called for service.  The pool and surrounding area are very nice also.  Only downside was kids are not allowed in the hot tub, even if they are sitting quietly right beside parent. The lifeguard will ask them to get out.  We had to wait about 30 minutes"
40,"We didn't want to stay in Guatemala city due to its bad reputation. So I looked for a nice hotel, a short ride from the airport, with restaurant. The Barcelo was perfect for it. Our room was beautiful, with 2 floors, large very comfortable bed, and nice shower with plenty of hot water and great water stream. What a treat after 2 weeks! We had dinner at the hotel's open buffet, and it was great and very fresh. We took a taxi from the hotel to the airport - 10 minutes ride, 10 Dollars. Just what we wanted."
50,"This hotel has the ambiance of luxury in the center of the city, near the restaurant/nightlife zone. The rooms are spacious, clean comfortable. The facilities are excellent and the restaurants serve good food at reasonable prices in a wonderful atmosphere. The pool area is pleasant and feels like a tropical oasis in the center of the busy city. The breakfast buffet is among the best and most varied as any I have enjoyed. This is a perfect hotel to stay for business or touring in Guatemala City."
40,I had to stay at this hotel overnight after landing at Guatemala Airport as roads were flooded.  Short notice emans paying high prices!  $140 just for me for 1 night wihtout breakfast.    I had a very light dinner and found out there was only one price at that was high!
30,"The hotel is a bit old, but very clean and well kept. My room had a king bed (which was hard as a rock) refrigerator, flat screen and sitting area. The amenity kit in the bathroom had everything you could possibly need and things you didn't know you needed; toothbrush, sewing kit, shoe polish and something that looked like a tongue depressor. The hotel has several restaurants on the lower level and a gym (tho I didn't get to check it out). Overall my stay was good - clean, quiet room, food options, security, wi-fi and shuttle service to GUA."
40,"Spent one night at this hotel,very nice sized rooms,great service. Free wifi, good location. Rooms are big  has an outside heated pool,spa and Gym. Great Breakfast Safe in the room Loved my stay here,enjoyable."
50,"Good price, the breakfast give a lot of options, the gym is big (their are 2 gyms and spinning/training room). The outdoor Jacusi and the outdoor pool (with warm water) are big. The staff is very freindly. "
50,"We stayed here for one night after arriving late in Guatemala City.  The airport pickup was free and easy.  The hotel is close to the airport. This hotel was almost awkwardly nice for the low price we paid.  The rooms were huge and comfortable.  The bathroom was well-stocked with shampoo, conditioner, soap, a sewing kit, a shoe polishing kit, a toothbrush, and more.  The room had a coffee maker with coffee and tea, a big TV, and an extremely comfortable bed. The complimentary breakfast buffet was amazing!  They had SO MANY options, from American-style to typical Guatemalan.  I particularly enjoyed the tamales, beans, cooked-to-order omelet station, and all the fruit juices. They have restaurants inside the hotel, including a sports bar that is open until 1:00am.  We were glad"
50,I stayed many hotel in guatemala city. But barcelo best for value of money. Very clean room and all hotel area. Excellent view. Swimming pool great. Breakfast has many choice.  I did not find any bad this hotel. I am recommend to stay this hotel. 
40,"We only needed one night each on arrival and departure from Guatemala City and wanted to be sure we were comfortable. For the value (paid no more here than for any of the small boutique hotels in Antigua and Lake Atitlan and from a sleep quality and linens/ towels quality about 200X better). Very comfortable, well located (especially if only here a day or two - there are things close by and of course the airport is VERy close). Staff were very helpful, the bed was great, water pressure great for showering, nice pool, drinks are horribly expensive though - 4 drinks at poolside cost us $60 USD. THAT was robbery - $35 would have been expected. But the buffet dinner is quite good and reasonably priced. WiFi is a PAID expense here and not included - that is a negative in today's"
50,"Recent stay as good as previous visits. Close to airport with a free hotel shuttle service.Very safe. Excellent customer service.Reasonable rates. Multiple dining options.Great breakfast buffet. Small but good gym in addition to spa and outdoor pool. A major plus for families are the 2 level rooms available on higher floors with two sleeping areas. Maybe not a destination place, but great for a starting point of a trip. Favored by air crews, mission groups, tourists and locals. Not the world's greatest hotel however it earns an excellent review for consistently meeting all of our needs. We will return!  "
40,"Stayed at this hotel  as part of a group tour Gate 1.  The hotel  is close to the Airport, only 10 minutes away.  The Hotel offer free transportation service from and to the airport.  On weekends almost all the restaurants near the hotel are close so service is limited on weekends.  There is a Mcdonals next door and a few fast food restaurants across the hotel. We  had lunch at the sports bar and we were not happy, the quality of the food is mediocre.  Breakfast at the hotel was good.  The Barcelo is a good place to stay because there is good security."
50,"MY WIFE AND I STAYED AT THE BARCELO, IN GUATEMALA CITY EN SEPTEMBER 2015.  Like always  we experience, great service, friendly staff.   The location it great, few minutes away from the airport Aurora  Great food and close to great restaurants"
40,Stayed here 3 times over 2 weeks . We normally stay at the Westin or Radisson . The rate for the Barcelo was so good we thought we would try it .  Pleasantly surprised !  The rooms are comfortable although the bathroom needs a bit of an update .  My partner loved the gym and sauna too .  We used the free shuttle from the airport which worked well .  Staff are efficient without being over friendly .  My big complaint is having to pay $10 for wifi . At first we were told by front desk that the fee only paid for one device ! Later when I asked again I was told it was for 2 devices .  I travel all over the world . How is that I can get free wifi in a tiny cafe in the middle of nowhere but not in a large corporate hotel . Such nonsense !  
50,Excellent hotel with excellent customer service.  Hotel room had all incidentals provided.    Very nice bed with soft comfortable pillows.  Slept great!  I had a deal with free breakfast and wi-fi.  Breakfast was buffet style with eggs to order as an option.  Excellent breakfast with a variety of fresh fruit and juices.  Papaya and platinos were delicioso!
50,"I was stressed yet happy that I had successfully managed to arrive at the Guatemala City Airport without missing my connecting flight in Atlanta. The flight from Philly was delayed and I had to run to catch the train to get from the domestic gate to the International gate.  Atlanta is a huge airport and gates are far apart. Although, I was tired from lack of sleep, I felt confident because Barcelo offers a free shuttle service to and from the airport. No haggling with taxi drivers, no concern that I might get into trouble. Expedia prepaid my hotel room, all I needed to do was fill the registration form. Lady Luck must have smiled upon me because I was given an upgrade, a suite, two floors connected by a spiral staircase. After checking out the suite, I returned to the front desk"
50,"Excellent stay both times we have used this hotel.  Amenities are very good and the staff were wonderful. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated in the main areas.  Rooms were clean, comfortable and very nice.  The shuttle service to the airport was only 5 minutes away and we were both picked up and dropped off at the airport easily."
40,"I led a group of 10 designers on a social design project/trip to Guatemala, booking 5 rooms for 7 nights PROS:  - reasonable price/value - convenient location just minutes from the airport - free airport shuttle - beautiful interior design in lobby and common areas - wi-fi (included in our package deal) - the best breakfast buffet I've ever had, ""I'm not kidding"" (included in our package deal)   - courteous English speaking staff - clean rooms - variety of quality restaurant and bar options at different price points - variety of gift shop options with nice a choice of merchandise, at different price points - beautiful pool, hot tub and spa (had the best massage of my life, ""I'm not kidding"") - best in-room coffee quality ever (this is where some of the best coffee in the world"
50,"My girlfriend and i had a one night stop here before our flight to Nicaragua the next morning. The hotel is large, beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly. The room was spacious and the beds were insanely comfortable. Next time I'm in Guatemala City i'm definitely staying here"
40,"I passed here just a night, Landing at almost at midnight and leaving the early morning. So need to say that my experience was very short. I want to say that at the end this is a good structure in terms of Quality-Price. I fully remained satisfied by the cleanliness and the furnishment of the Hotel. Toilet was clean and Bed was great."
40,"For the price, this is my favorite stay in Guatemala City.  It is safe, has good food, pools, and a partial gym. The rooms are fine. It has a free shuttle to the airport and free breakfast (at least mine was). There are some drawbacks--for example, I had trouble with my keycards. Drinks are expensive so walk down the street to the store (La Torre) and get a bottle (I am cheap)."
30,"I can only recommend staying here if you are attending a conference.  It is very convenient and secure.  Traffic can be tricky in the city so no reason to be anywhere else.  Staff is friendly, rooms are comfortable, albeit dated.  Bonus, if you read my posts, I am always happy if water, internet, breakfast and coffee are included in the price of the room!  My rate included all of these amenities...so this is definitely a big plus here."
40,"Nice! This place looks pretty inside.. The room was pretty large, I had a nice desk where I could work for a bit. My view from the balcony  was very nice and the pool was clean and comfortable. I liked the area, it is very close to the airport I'd  say about a 7 min drive... I also found a lot of places nearby where you can grab a bite. Would I come back? Of course! Staff was very friendly and acomodating i also also felt very safe."
40,"Nice infrastructure, comfortable rooms, nice and kind personnel. The restaurants are very good, -not great- and the food variety is remarkable. Local, Japanese, American Dinner, Sea Food, Spanish...they need to catch up a bit with technology and decide whether they want to let their guests sleep late on Sunday morning or have a rock band wake them up at 6:00 AM. Avoid first level floors...at least up to the 3rd, they are really contaminated by the noise from the ballroom. The gym could be a lot better, but the swimming pool and the volleyball/basketball court a plus."
50,"We came to Guatemala City for a 10 day stay as a family a of 4.  We stayed in a 2-level duplex.  Parents upstairs and boys on 1st level.  Room was clean and well appointed.  There is a great fitness and racquet club for hotel guests and members.  Fantastic steam room, cardio machines and weights.  Pool was lovely and at the right temperature.  Security is VERY good.  We ate breakfast several times and it is a great value!!  We walked during the day to zone viva and had no problems.  Try the Gallo cerveza.  Beats the mass produced swirl in the U.S.  Food at St Strikers pretty solid and reminded us of Buffalo Wild Wings.  We have previously stayed at the Westin and the Hotel Intercontinental.  From an overall price/value relationship we think that the Barcelo has been our best"
50,"Went back to Guatemala, and stayed in this nice Barceló hotel, and had the same good experiences: nice service, safe environment, walked around 5 blocks to the mall, and 2 blocks to the supermarket.  On the weekend, went to the zoo, very close by.  Marvelous experience, and on my next trip I know that Barceló will be my hotel of choice."
50,"We needed a hotel near the airport for an early morning international flight and we wanted to be comfortable and safe; this hotel was perfect for that.  The front desk was very accommodating when we wanted adjoining rooms.  When the door adjoining the two rooms was locked, I called front desk and within ""1"" minute, someone was there to unlock the door.    The rooms and bathrooms were very nice.  The bar downstairs had a good atmosphere and my wife and I shared a nice Chilean red wine.  The shops, courtyard and pool areas allowed my family to roam around and not feel trapped.  We ordered room service for the family; the food was good; good variety to choose from; and was delivered 40 minutes later on a rolling table (very nice).  The airport shuttle was free and ran every hour on"
40,"I've stayed at the Barcelo location for many years, beginning back when it was the El Dorado hotel and later when it was run by Marriott.  Barcelo has taken over now and kept many of the best aspects of the hotel. it's big hotel, with both the advantages and disadvantages. The rooms are good, but the smaller rooms have cramped bathrooms with shower doors that oddly open inwards.  The staff is excellent and if you don't speak Spanish you'll find that even the bellboys speak English. The people at the desk are fluent in English.  The pool is a big attraction, and it's great. The restaurants are good and the brunch is extravagant (although I preferred the offerings when the hotel was run by Marrriott).  The location is fine if you don't mind taking a cab. sometimes, however, you"
40,"A nice hotel but rough around the edges, which is too bad.  Rooms are well out together with comfy slippers and robes, comfortable beds and the option for real air (small window that opens) which is rare in hotels in buildings.  But the blackout curtains are gross, stained and brown spotted. The carpets are worn down and the walls look a bit dated. It's nicely cleaned and sheets are comfy. I appreciated the shampoo, conditioner and bathgel are in pump dispensers in the tub wall which helps diminish waste with the little containers. If you get the breakfast included it's a nice buffet with lots of good tasty options. If you go to the gym, head past the smaller guest gym, out to the pool  area then into the fitness center, it is way better equipped and there are also classes. Pool"
50,"The hotel is very good, rooms and accommodations are what is expected from this level of hotel, good location, good appointments - however, there is the tendency to nickel and dime the guest, where WiFI is normally freely available, this hotel charges - some guests complained about charges for a bottle of water etc. Even at breakfast you feel that you are being monitored.  The staff could be somewhat more obliging - they appear to be under stress, the guest appears to be secondary to whatever task they are doing. Prices in hotels are normally high, but the Barceló appears to have added few percentage points more on the cost of everything."
40,Family came to visit so we all converged at this hotel.  the location was very central for our needs and the pool was a great attraction for the children.  We also enjoyed the Sunday breakfast buffet.  We'd go here again!
40,"I'm in Guatemala often for work and vacation, and this is my favorite hotel in Guatemala City. The pool area is fantastic, and the rooms are clean. The staff are all nice and helpful. The only reason I don't give it a five is that the restaurant service is often very slow. "
50,"Located ten minutes by road from the airport, and offering a free pick-up if forewarned, the Barceló is a convenient choice of accommodation particularly if arriving in the evening.  More than that, it offers comfortable spacious rooms and an excellent buffet breakfast that includes a wide range of hot and cold options to suit local and international dietary requirements.  As would be expected of a hotel of this stature many other services are provided, although when enquiries were made concerning options for onward travel, there was a lack of local knowledge.  On the edge of the hotel / entertainment zone, there are a range of restaurants nearby.  Guatemala City, particularly after dark, is not the most welcoming of places but the area around the hotel appeared safe and there"
40,"Nice hotel close to airport with all facilities that you would need.  Rooms are a good size, not the best location if a tourist as area not the safest.  If in Guatemala City for a few days would highly recommend staging in Antigua much more tourist friendly.  But if looking for something close to airport or for business then this is a good location and price."
50,"Hotel Barcelo is well located just a block away from important landmark ""El Obelisco"" probably the busiest and most important intersection in Guatemala City. This hotel has two buildings concoct with a huge and still elegant lobby where you will be welcomed by a friendly staff. In the first floor there is the main restaurant where you will have your complementary breakfast with a selection of over a dozen dishes, plus extras like fruit bar, cereal, and side orders. There is also an sport bar, business centre, gym, patio and a large heated pool with jacuzzi and bar.   Rooms are decente size, clean and include all the amenities you may expect for a hotel of this category. The rooms and the hotel in general are starting to look dated but I will still recommend this hotel for both"
40,"The hotel is centrally located and is about 5-10 minutes to the airport.  The hotel is full service with a sports bar with typical fare and TVs, a Japanese restaurant (which I did not try but looked excellent).  The main restaurant offers a buffet with almost too many choices.  The lobby bar is a good location for an after dinner drink and people watching.  There was a piano player one night while I visited.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for great accommodations in Guatemala City."
50,"Beautiful inside and out, the restaurants inside are good. The place stays guarded 24/7. The spa and nail salon was amazing. The pool and jacuzzi were beautiful and the pool is heated. My only complaint is that the bed(we had a king) was very firm...not comfortable at all. Good luck finding anyone who speaks English haha but it's expected."
50,"Wonderful staff at this hotel. Very nice, clear-speaking (both English and Spanish) and helpful at every turn. Clean rooms, nice amenities, comfortable beds, shopping within the hotel, multiple restaurants to choose from, one of which has an extensive buffet with many options. Would definitely stay there again."
50,"A great choice in the central area of Guatemala City. This used to be the Marriott Hilton. The rooms are large and modern. I prefer the ones with a balcony. Each room has a small safe, iron and ironing board, cable TV, air con and modern attached bathroom. There is an attached fitness centre, large pool and hot tub. Within the hotel are ATM's for cash, a few restaurants and offices for United Airlines and American Airlines which allow you to complete a pre-check in. There is also a Business Centre. The hotel offers a free collection and drop off at the airport."
40,This hotel is conveniently located near the city's airport and has everything a traveller needs. The rooms are spacious and well equipped and the staff are very helpful. There is a free shuttle bus to the airport every hour. The main restaurant has a combination of buffet and a-la-carte and the choice is good. You do get a fair bit of airplane noise but the windows are well insulated and there was no flights at night as far as I could tell. I would not hesitate to come back.
50,"Really nice business hotel. Comfortable beds, desk, fridge, and air conditioning. Had shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and every other necessity in bathroom kit (even packaged toothbrush, comb, and shoe horn.) Bath/shower combo had descent pressure and hot water, but the shower cycled with cool water. Very clean and immaculately decorated. Interesting shops and various restaurants downstairs. Could see McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Pizza Hut all within walking distance from balcony. About a 5 minute drive from the airport for $10. Took the complementary shuttle back to airport next day. Good Wifi. Perfect layover or one-day stay hotel."
50,"I have stayed here several times. Very good hotel, with clean, comfortable rooms. Staff is extremely friendly, helpful and kind.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful. Nice views from balcony to Guatemala city. Nice and safe area , good location."
50,"Probably the best hotel I have stay in Guatemala so far. I visit Guatemala every year to teach and this time I pick this hotel because location. Room is very comfortable, clean and service is excellent. Will definitely pick this one again"
20,"We stayed one night during our travel. The location of the hotel near Zona Viva and the airport are definitely a big plus.We also got a free pick up and drop off to the airport. The facilities are nice .  The reason we were not happy was their shabby service. My friend asked the check in counter lady as to what was an appropriate amount to tip the bellhop per suitcase. She replied 5$. My friend was taken aback and said even in U.S. we do not tip that high- she insolently shrugged her shoulders and said ""well you asked"". I find it hard to believe that the tipping rate is that hiGh. After a few hours we wanted them to give us directions to the number one rated restaurant onTA and in zona viva. They had not heard about it and seemed to have trouble finding it. One would think the"
20,"I know see what other reviewers meant by poor customer service... Room service? They will interrupt you while you eat to charge you. They don't pick up the dirty dishes (one less interruption!) pool bar closes at 5! at 5!!! i would go on tours and return after 5pm, so i was never able to take advantage of it. One night I wanted to have a cocktail by the Jacuzzi and asked one of the workers to please find me a waiter, and he told me someone would come soon, and that service to the pool ended at 7. very disappointed! not to mention, wifi is not free. and there is no service by the pool area, so don't even spend your $$. the room keys would get disabled everyday, so I would have to run downstairs to get new keys because I couldn't open my room."
40,"The hotel was nice, rooms clean and facilities well maintained.  The only criticism is the usual uncharge $10 US a day for internet, which is outrageous for this type of hotel.  Restaurant buffet was generous but not memorable.  Staff was responsive and would recommend"
50,"Luxurious hotel.  Beautiful inside.  Friendly staff.  Clean, comfortable rooms.  Several restaurants to choose from.  Ate dinner at the Asian restaurant.  Miso soup and fried rice was very good.  Loved the option of American or Guatemalan breakfast."
40,"This is a large hotel with many extra facilities, bars and restaurants.   The rooms are comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful.  We stayed here two separate days within a week as our base between tours.  On our first stay we left a new tablet charging cord.  We were able to retrieve the cord on the second stay, a credit to the cleaning staff.  My only complaint is that the food and drink at the several restaurants/bars we used were very expensive, especially considering what similar meals and drinks cost in the local economy."
50,"I went to this hotel during a business trip. Location is great, very close to the airport, shops, and restaurants. Lots of families were visiting. It has some options in the hotel for food, I tried both and they are ok, not the best but good enough if you don't want to leave the hotel. The beef Tataki in the Japanese Restaurant is really good. The hotel is very safe for those of you concern about safety."
40,"Barcelo' used to be Pan American I guess as it comes up that way on Google maps.  It's extremely close to the hotel.  The area behind the hotel has a few places you can walk to to view the sites and the main road has some historical sites you can see.  Overall, if you only have a few days, it's a really nice place and even with the planes, the rooms are extremely quiet (no noise).  The pool and breakfast buffet is very good.  The staff are great and very helpful .  I would recommend this place to any first time travelers."
50,"Stayed just one night in transit from US to Antigua, Guatemala.  Staff was very accommodating.  Was able to communicate with them by email before arrival, and when experiencing flight delays enroute.  Airport shuttle (no extra charge) was waiting for me at airport; driver pretty fluent in English.  Room and bed were comfortable.  Included two small balconies with sliding glass doors.  No need for a/c.  Slept with both doors open (7th floor).  The breakfast buffet was wonderful ($10. charge).  Large variety of food with table service.  Both indoor and patio seating.  Wished I could have relaxed by the pool all day, but, alas, no time.  When my connection to Antigua did not arrive as scheduled, the desk clerks kindly made a phone call for me (I had no phone service, first time in"
40,"I stayed here twice during a recent trip, once because of a flight that came in late and another because of a very early morning flight. The staff was helpful, the building was pleasant and felt secure. The beds were quite hard, but the rooms were fairly spacious and quite clean. The breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was delicious and started at 5 am, which was helpful. The sports bar was great for dinner--surprisingly good and not super expensive. Finally, the free airport shuttle made our transfers very simple. A good place to start or end a trip."
40,"Stayed for one night only with my family.  Overall experience was great. Good and clean room , great check inn staff very helpful and comprehensive with our needs. Free shuttle complimentary service was on time and perfect to get to the airport.  We arrived late but we had several options for dinner at the same hotel so everything was as expected.  If you look for a quality hotel , this is Barcelo.  Great fares if booking in advance and all advantages of a good hotel chain.  Perfect for families .  We missed breakfast for our early flight but I was told it was pretty good.   Room ' cleanness was ok and we had a perfect rest  thank AC was working perfectly .  Nice views from balcony to Guatemala city. Nice and safe area , good location."
50,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  This hotel is very close from Aurora International Airport.  (you can literally see the runaway from the hotel), somehow the aircraft did not bother me.  The hotel offers free airport shuttle.  It is located in the financial district of Guatemala City, lots of banks and restaurants nearby within a few blocks walking distance.  I really felt very safe at this hotel as security in and around the hotel are prominent.  The room was clean, up to date with all amenities.  the breakfast buffet was awesome with fresh fruit juices, omelets made to order, assorted breads, etc.  I would stay here again.  the staff is super friendly and professional.  There is currency exchange at the front desk and there are atm's located at the lobby."
40,"Barcelo was renovated several years ago. It is one of the best and most modern hotels in Guatemala City. The hotel entails a few restaurants and bars as well as a gym and a swimming pool. The pool is one of the largest pools that hotels in Guatemala City offer.  The drawback is that this hotel is located in Zona 9, and it's not that far from Zona Viva, it's not recommended to walk down there. Do take a taxi! "
50,"I asked to be waken up at 3:30. as soon as I received the phone call I asked to send somebody to pick up my luggage I had 2 big bags, 50 pounds each, my carry on and a purse. I knew that the shuttle was living at 4 AM sharp. They didn't arrived and I left the room pushing one bag to the elevator, returning for the other one..When I arrived the shuttle had left 4 minutes earlier....  I complained in reception and asked for a taxi... when the taxi arrived they said that they will pay for the taxi...That's service and assuming responsibilities..."
50,"Our family is involved in non-profit high stress work in Guatemala and the Barcelo has always been a place to get away for a night or two two or three times a year.  Great service, the breakfast buffet, close location to the malls and other activities in the city make it an ideal place.  Sunday mornings the Avenida Reforma is closed to traffic for several hours so makes a wonderful place to walk, ride bike, and just get out and walk.  We look forward to going back again!"
30,"Barceló Guatemala City has really good service, however by being in an old building that had its renewal a while ago (that's how it looks), you can have some experiences that are not really pleasant. Room: noisy A/C, carpet that doesn't feel very clean, but the worse by far is the shower; my first experience (at 6:00 AM) was a constant swing between cold and boiling water (I even measured the swinging... 20 seconds). I'm no expert, but this has to be something related to the old systems managing water supply when in high demand. Other than this, Hotel has very good meeting facilities and good service too."
40,"My husband oldest son and myself stayed at this hotel 2 nights while in Guatemala.   I was so impressed when we walked in to being with this is a beautiful hotel.   I found it interesting as well with so many interesting things -- such as a shoe shine station on the floor we stayed on, the ice machine built into the wall as a fancy attachment, antique dial telephones to use in the lobby.   I liked the security of having to use your key card to operate the elevators.  But the really interesting aspect was you had to use your key card to keep the lights and a/c on in the room.   Ironically we had to ask for face towels for that is not something stocked in the room.  Fortunately the water in the room is cost free - or at least we didn't see any price listed.   The sports bar in"
40,"If you want to be in the city and close to the airport and from there travel to Antigua and other places, this could be a good headquarters place to be. Breakfast is included as well as the shuttle to and from airport."
50,We took a group of students and stayed here one night. The rooms and service were first rate. The sports bar had karaoke which our students loved. The pool and breakfast were also superior. Overall an excellent choice for us.
50,"I stayed here for a school trip and was quite pleased with the selection. The staff was polite and very helpful. The rooms were delightful and there was ample space for my friend and I in a 2 bedroom. The complementary breakfast definitely hit the spot prior to our departure for our days adventure. I did not get to try the pool or hot tub but they looked so inviting and comfortable. Also their wifi is free and fast, so that was an additional bonus! My overall experience with the hotel was fantastic. I would highly recommend it as a place to stay during your visit to Guatemala City."
50,"This hotel is Excellent! It has everything you could possibly need. Various restaurants, shuttle service to and from the airport! The rooms are spacious and nice! The staff was excellent! Location right there next to Zona 10. the Zona viva! Im definitely coming back on my next business trip. The breakfast buffet is also very good."
50,"Barcelo is my favorite iplace to stay when flying into or out of Guatemala City.  It's super-close to the airport, and has shuttles with drivers that have been immensely helpful to my family, checking status of incoming flights for us!  The shuttle between the airport and hotel is truly just a matter of minutes.  The hotel itself is luxurious, and I believe it's the only hotel in Guatemala City with a heated pool.  There are several restaurants in the hotel, and every employee I've encountered has been supremely courteous. There's also a supermarket a block away!"
50,"We only stayed for a night, but the room was simply beautiful, everything worked as it should the food in the sports bar was great and the included breakfast was lovely too.  well worth the money.  thank you to all of the saff."
50,"This is an old hotel, but has been refurbished completely. Good wifi, and great location near everything in Zona Viva Guatemala. Service Staff is very nice. They have Sauna which is very good when tired of your shopping."
40,"After almost 24 hours of flights to Guatemala, we were looking for a nice, comfortable hotel, near the airport, to rest before we continue our trip to Antigua and the highlands. Well the Barcelo Hotel certainly reached our expectations: Close to the airport, modern hotel, comfortable large room, rich breakfast and a pool. The staff was very helpful and enabled us to leave part of our luggage for two weeks until our departure to Cuba. I  recommend this hotel as an anchor for arrivals and departures."
30,"Spent 2 weeks at the hotel. Room was a single on the 6 floor, smoking floor. Overall the room was clean, commodities descent but the TV was glued to the wall so the only right angle for viewing was from the bed. The bathroom looked a bit aged but overall very clean. The laundry service was good and the room service descent. Only complain was that room service generally took longer than expected, on average 40 minutes. The local restaurant was very good. Breakfast had good variety of fresh fruits and omlets  were excellent. Check out was very slow and this is why would not rate higher. Had issues with final bill preparation and unfortunately a charge on my credit card was made after my check out. Currently under claim but no clear answer from hotel. Has good parking area both"
30,"The hotel was nice and the location is perfect since it is so close to the airport. It was a good spot to end our two-week Guatemala vacation. Our biggest complaint was that the walls are REALLY thin!! Our room was on the third floor which must have been above one of the hotel's ballrooms. We could easily hear the music from a wedding until 12am. Then at 6am a church service began and we could easily hear the music from that service as well. It was so loud you could hear the individual instruments. We called the front desk to complain but didn't hear a noticeable difference. We stayed with family and their room was on the 5th floor and they said they didn't hear any of it.   It was a nice hotel, just be aware of the noise and know that the walls don't block a lot of sound. If"
50,"My wife and I took an eight day trip to Guatemala City and stayed at the Barcelo' Hotel. It's conveniently located near the airport and we took advantage of the free shuttle. More impressively was the driver was waiting at the airport exit with our names after the flight information was provided to the hotel. The breakfast buffet was huge and had a nice selection of fruits, vegetables, cereals, eggs, an omelet station, and juices. Security is very tight which makes guests feel safe. There are TWO gyms on the property as well as the large pool and whirlpool. Free wifi."
50,"Everything is great in this hotel. You'll love it. The food in the restaurant is awsome, you also have a sports bar which is great also. The spa place is old but ok.... Not so great. The pool small they have a hot tub there BIG."
40,"Just returned from a trip to Guatemala and enjoyed the short time at this center city hotel (5 minutes from the airport and yes, the airport is right in the middle of the city).  Food at La Vista is fine but really enjoyed the sports bar where food was better.  Rooms are really spacious with balconies and seating.  Pool area is enjoyable and lobby bar is friendly."
50,"We spend the night with my boys, and it was just splendid. We really love this place. We use maybe all attractions, specially the pool. It is great. The temp. was fine and the size is just perfect. The Room was very nice, a little with dust under the bed, but good after that. (I saw the dust, just for my kids was playing under it). The food is great also."
40,"This is my first travel to Guatemala for a business trip. The hotel looks a bit old, but the room I stayed in was clean. Barcelo hotel lived up to my expectations in terms of service. People were friendly and hospitable. The Breakfast buffet is great! Food servings are huge and food tastes good! Room Rates were very reasonable."
40,"We just needed a hotel for one night in Guatemala city - en-route to other spots in the country.  This hit the spot with ease.  Very up scale with several restaurants.  We especially liked the Kyoto Japanese restaurant.  Fond was delicious and service was outstanding.  The room was spacious and very well appointed.  I did not notice any  need for refurbishment that others have reported.  The only downside is the noise, both interior and exterior.  You can easily hear conversations from nearby rooms.  And the airplanes sure get your attention.  The hotel is very security conscious with guards/employees in sight everywhere.  You even need a room key to have electricity in your room."
40,"This was a great hotel for exactly the purposes we needed. I traveled with a 13 year old so I was concerned about safety when our flight was due to arrive at midnight. They had free airport pick-up with their hotel name on a placard. They took us right to the hotel, the check-in was very easy and I had pre-paid on booking.com. The showers were powerful and wonderfully warm. The beds were comfy and the windows even blocked out the constant sirens of the capital city. There were lots of channels available and my booking came with free wifi which I’m not sure is the case with every booking.   The breakfast was an extra $8 CDN for two people (done on booking.com) and it’s worth it for sure. Buffet style and an incredible amount of options available. Omelet station, fresh fruit,"
30,"I stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City as I have stayed there many times over the last 10 years.  The staff at check in seemed to know little about what was included in the room rate, which is important to those who want to enjoy the excellent breakfast buffet at the hotel.  However, the wi-fi prices are too high and should be free for guests, but you only get two wi-fi accesses included in the room.  The rooms could use some upgrade of furniture, carpet, and overall newness to keep the place competitive with the other hotels in the area in zone 9 and 10. A free shuttle to the airport is offered which is nice and works great."
30,"Stayed there one night on business in April and used the shuttle transfer from the airport, which they offer free of charge. Hence I should not complain that we had to wait almost one hour until we finally left the airport.  Check in and out was handled promptly, courtesouly and professionally so the twenty minutes between arrival and pre-arranged massage were just enough to get into the room and take a shower.   I was on floor 7, no smoking. Room 764 was clean and spacious, aircon working, flatscreen TV too and nice surprise the coffe making facility with a free bottle of still water. Bathroom spacious too, well lit. Toilet very old, yet clean. Amenities ok, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner in spenders in the shower but no body lotion. Walls and paper thin and need mending -"
40,"Barcelo Guatemala City   Total of 3 nights.  WiFi was available but only if you paid $10 USD per day to use it.  I did use the business office computer but it would only let me browse the internet and would not let me send email or due to my banks security would not let me use bill pay.  This hotel was used by the tour group that we were travelling with.  First two nights were great with an excellent view from the eighth floor of the volcanoes and city.  Last night there we had a 3rd floor view of the air conditioning system on the back side of the hotel. Security for the hotel was very visible at all times. Safe provided in room for passports and valuables.  Rooms were very clean. Exercise room that I used, swimming pool and jacuzzi, also a scenic tropical area to visit within"
30,The hotel has a security fence and the lobby is nice.  Then you go to your room and it is just ok.  Rooms are not as good as you would think.    The staff was friendly and pleasant.     The breakfast was ok.    You are close to airport and downtown.    Also close to a grocery store.   Overall it was safe and clean.  
30,"Good hotel to stay a night if your going to and from Antigua. The taxis outside the lobby will drive you to Antigua, we paid $40 gor 4 people. Clean but dated , good breakfast buffet. Close to the airport, close enough to the Zoo and an Artisan's Market, not much else though. "
40,"Not a bad hotel.  Close to the airport and walking distance to a couple restaurants. The pool looked awesome but didnt have to time to use, only spent one night. Good variety of food for the breakfast buffet.  Staff was very friendly.   The bad:  Rooms are a little dated and wifi was spotty.  Also they will ask for an email when you check-in...got a lot of emails from the company soon after, just be forewarned.  I know rookie mistake but I was tired when I checked in."
50,"My wife and I closed our 14 days in Guatemala by staying the last two nights near the airport to rest up before flying out. This hotel was great. The pool was refreshing. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The price is great. However, the one knock is they need to have better service poolside in the afternoons."
50,"The location is in a very nice área. The hotel has a nice pool, jacuzzi, the reception is very nice. The romos size are Ok. The courtesy breakfast is complete, everyday is a different menú buffet. It has fresh fruits . the hotel has stores, restaurant like sushi. If you need microwave they send you one with no cost. I recommend this hotel. It has free wifi."
20,"Nice hotel but the service is awful!! Even you are member of the hotel frequent customers, due to the fact that you made the order using travel agent, you are not eligible to the frequent customers benefits!! I am traveling allot all over the world and this is the first time I heard such sentence from shift manager at hotel. This was my first and last experience with Barcelo Guatemala City!!"
50,"On a first time visit to Guatemala on business I didn't know what standard to expect from the hotels there. This hotel although slightly dated was a gem. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms very spacious with all amenities you would require and food was excellent in the restaurant.  The hotel caters for every type of traveller with very nice pool area, gym, shops etc. Very close to the airport. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend."
40,"If you want to make an easy entry, or exit for that matter, into Guatemala, the Barcelona is your ticket. The vibe is opulence, at least for Guatemala. It is very close to the airport and they do have a free pick and drop off.  The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed. The restaurants are good but expensive. The neighborhood is very close to a selection of restaurants, but you may need a cab to take full advantage of zone 10.  One of the best things about the hotel is its breakfast. An incredible variety is offered, it is served in a nice atmosphere, and it is included. Certainly not cheap on Guatemalan standards, but a decent value."
30,"Barceló hotels have a nice lobby, but their desk clerks do not speak English, and are not receptive to their guests needs. Both in Costa Rica and in Guatemala City,I got some of the worst rooms they had , and it took many requests to change to a satisfactory one. The dinner buffet did not change very much, and the meat sat under a warmer too long, making it too dry to eat. Breakfast was good, though."
40,"We spent the night before and final night of an excellent Caravan tour of Guatemala at this beautiful, old style hotel (lots of dark wood, free shoe buffers near the elevators, classic silver rotary dial phones in the lobby, etc.) a quick drive from the airport in Guatemala City. We had several good buffet meals in the large poolside restaurant and especially enjoyed the omelette and pasta chefs; good selection of food and juices and, for a buffet, unusually good desserts. The area surrounding this hotel however, is not good for wandering because, while not packed with tall buildings, it is a busy, very dirty, frantic urban tangle with few traffic lights, no honored crosswalks, an unsettling number of armed security guards and a woefully neglected stretch of parks with broken"
40,"nice amenities, great location (safe and close to the zona viva and airport), good breakfast (if included). Only thing is that wifi is not standard included (make sure to ask if wifi is included in the price you pay for the room). This is big minus for a such a wonderful hotel; all hotels have free wifi nowadays. I therefore don't understand why wifi is not included. Other than that it was avery comforatble stay at Barcelo."
50,"A quiet room with super amenities! Perfect for a night near the airport!  Great service and good price.  I give it 5 stars.  We will definitely stay here again.  Check out the pool, health club, and shops."
40,"The hotel is convenient to the airport and has a free shuttle. Just call ahead to give them your flight details and they'll meet you just outside. It is a bit dated, but is still a well appointed grand-in-its-day hotel, with lots of marble. (Like some of the big pricey chain hotels serving convention centers in Boston and DC.) I didn't walk around the outside of the hotel, but inside the hotel grounds you feel very safe.   A large, hot, and tasty buffet breakfast is included. The hotel also has a smaller guest only workout gym and then a larger health/gym facility (I didn't see this one) on site. There's also an outdoor pool that looked nice, but we didn't have time to use.   The staff were all very nice. I definitely stay there again."
50,"Stayed here through Gate 1 Travel and was impressed on all levels. The reception staff remembered my name even after we left for a night and returned. The free breakfast was great...options for those of us on limited diets as well as every other food group known to me! Best of all, the coffee (delicious) just kept coming... The rooms are clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable, the sheets were soft and inviting. Thankfully there are two ATM's within the hotel, as I ran out of dollars two days before leaving for home. For those who fear that Guatemala City is dangerous, the Barcelo is the place to stay. My travel companion and I even walked around the corner to the local supermarket (during daylight hours) to buy a sim card for my phone. Not only did we not have any problems,"
50,"After traveling to Xela and the municipios of Huehuetenango, Barceló is the relaxing place to stay in Guatemala City, they are well in control with there security and they have few restaurants inside the hotel facility, KFC, Mcdonalds on the corner. I like to sleep no worry and I will stay here again. Wifi works excellent like here in USA."
40,"I stayed for a second time last february and it was top notch. Accomodations were great and service was as well. Meals were impressive. Security is present, taxis are available. Pool is climatized. There's a supermarket close by, as well as restaurants and shopping centers less than five minutes away by car."
50,"Very friendly people, security all around, fast response to calls, very clean hotel.  I do recommend this hotel, and in my next trip, this will be the hotel of my choice.  Also, places to eat, a mall, a market at walking distance, and places to eat.  Fast and friendly transportation from airport."
40,"We stayed here for one night in early March, because we found a favourable rate that included wi-fi and buffet breakfast. The hotel lobby appears grand, and caters to mix of business travelers and tourists. Lobby service was polite, but average at best. We arrived before noon, and they were able to accommodate an early check-in. The rooms are clean, but average - nothing special. The wi-fi was strong and reliable and the AC worked perfectly. The bed was very comfortable. The pool is AMAZING! It is huge, not too deep, and long enough to do proper laps.The water is very clean and it was as warm as bathwater - such a treat in an area where most pools are ice cold. The Jacuzzi was also large with strong jets and has a nice sitting area. Plenty of lounge chairs are located on the"
40,"I rrcomend the hotel, for a bussines purpode, i had a problem eith my bathroom and the fixed asap. I also like the security feeling that you feel during your stay at the hotel, theres a los of security personel very polites.  Rhe crew on the front desk, the best!"
40,"Was a great experience, amazing view, good services. I recommend them on your next trip to Guatemala city.  The rooms are clean and you find all the necessary to feel at home. Just a suggestion with the shampoo and conditionador that you put in the bathroom you need to change them frequently."
20,"Part of a group of hotels, this hotel is convenient for the airport. That is about it!  The front desk is impersonal and like an airport check-in in a grim country. Wi-fi is not free. Everything costs money.  On the plus side the rooms are clean (but average) with free tea and coffee. The bathroom was adequate with shampoo etc provided. The breakfast was standard and not worth writing about. The antiquated air conditioning controls did hold up through the one night I spent in this hotel.  The Sports bar was good but billing was mired in red tape. The bar meals were basic and expensive although grandly presented. (There is a McDonalds next door which is probably a better option than dining here, at least cost wise)  The Lounge Bar was busy with usually one girl running it. In"
50,"beautiful property..the room was lovely, clean, nice amenities, great bathroom(Loved the private toilet area),and very quiet...friendly, efficient, attentive staff.!!!We ordered room service. for a late dinner...excellent food at a very reasonable price. Took the 4:00 a.m. shuttle to the airport .....so convenient, a short 10min ride...very prompt. we regret not having a leisurely morning to spend at the hotel. Will definately stay again."
50,"WhenI booked my trip to visit my daughter in Guatemala she suggested that I spend my last night at Hotel Barcelo. This way I was close to the airport as I was leaving the next day. I am so glad that I agreed. When we arrived at the hotel I was immediately impressed with the fact that staff were at the front to take your luggage, As we entered the hotel the large and beautiful lobby caught my attention. Checking in was efficiently done and as my Spanish is limited English speaking staff was a bonus. We also learned that we had been upgraded. Our luggage was delivered to our huge suite. For dinner we had a choice of 3 restaurants to eat in and we decided to try the Sports Bar as we just wanted a light dinner. We had a good meal for a reasonable price. The hotel also has a swimming"
40,"We spent a night here to avoid the hectic Guatemalan City traffic. The hotel offers shuttle service to the airport that is literally 10 minutes away. The room was clean, the staff was friendly and polite. Their breakfast buffet was tasty though the service was a bit forgetful. Great price and perfect location for those early flights."
50,"The Hotel Barceló is conveniently located near the Guatemala City airport, shopping and fine dining in the heart of Guatemala City.  The rooms are large and feature extra amenities such as flat screen TVs, a safe, wet bar, toiletries, a comfortable robe and a variety of pillows so you can find just the right softness. The staff is friendly and there is a healthy presence of security on site.  The buffet featured a wide variety of typical and continental choices that will definitely tempt you to overeat.  A very pleasant stay."
30,"This facility is close to the Guatemala Airport, making it very convenient for transfers, and a bit noisy as would be expected for an airport hotel.  The lobby and public areas are quite pleasant with a ""club"" like feel (stained wood, marble floors, etc).  The restaurant food is ample, but of average quality.  English quality is very adequate for the non-Spanish speaker.  The sleeping rooms are well appointed and clean.  One gets a sense of the age of the building from the bathrooms.  Though they have been painted and retiled, the plumbing is loud and the temperature in the shower is highly variable... ranging from scalding to frigid throughout a 5-minute shower.  The beds are very firm and have clean and fresh linens.  The meeting rooms are cavernous.  There is significant echo"
30,"I was staying in El Barcelo for work. The room was nice and clean, and breakfast was good and with a big variety. Nevertheless it is just another chain hotel, it could be anywhere else in the world, it´s okay yet not outstanding."
40,"Used this property for three days during recent trip.  On the surface, the property looks great.  When you look deeper, you see some wear and tear throughout.  Staff very attentive.  Proximity to the airport a great plus."
50,I booked a 1 night stay in one of their cheapest rooms. When I arrived this room was not available and the put me in a suite at no extra charge. The suite was amazing! It was beautifully appointed with a wonderful view of the city sky line. Their were actually two floor connected by a spiral stair case leading to the upstairs bed room. I can only say wow...it was my nicestest hotel stay in Guatemala City yet. The shuttle two and from the airport is easy and comes often. I would return without question but now having seen the suite it would be hard to stay in any other space. If you can afford it book it. The pool area was nice and the rest of the hotel was attractive.  On the downside...when I checked in I was told that I had a choice between their free breakfast and free Wi Fi.
50,"My departure from Guatemala in early February was delayed by the eruption of the Fuego Volcano. The airport was shut down, but fortunately our group was able to find rooms at the Barcelo, close to the airport. After the chaos of the airport, it was a haven of peace. We enjoyed lunch at the restaurant and later drinks and dinner at the comfortable lobby bar, where the servers pulled together tables to accomodate our party of ten. My room was very nice, with a large bathroom and amenities. My only complaint was that the bathroom had a sour smell. When I called housekeeping, a maid arrived at once to remop the floor - problem solved. A hotel shuttle took me promptly to the airport at five a.m. the next morning. Several of my friends, who left the following day, stated that they"
40,"My friend and I checked into the Barcelo to shorten the travel time to the airport. After staying in a rather large, 10 room homestay in Antigua, the Barcelo was paradise. It is a western style hotel with running hot/cold water in the sink, hot and strong shower, heated pool (great to use their terry cloth robe and slippers), a dinner buffet for US$25 which was excellent. Everything worked in our room. It was clean, comfortable bed and great pillows. No- it won't meet any 2015 design standards however, it's great value for the money. Our price via getaroom was US$100.00. Note the shuttle is free and leaves on the hour. We ended up taking a taxi- beware- the YELLOW taxis are the cheapest. We were charged 40Q to go to the National airport (10 min away) at 4:45am in the morning but"
40,"I thought my review of this hotel originally was going to be poor because my top criteria for any hotel is a good night's sleep . . . and the bed was rock hard.  Like ""my hips and tail bone hurt from sleeping on it"" hard.  By the second night, I used the large pillows to make a ""bed"" on the bed.  The housekeeping staff obviously noticed this and on the third night, a thick blanket and mattress topper had been added that made it MUCH more comfortable.  The room came with a ton of toiletries, including a shower puff!  Otherwise, the room was like a nice (think Hyatt Place) room and I had pretty nice views of the city as well (see my photos).  I wasn't surprised, since I read the reviews, that you have to pay for internet - roughly $35/week.  What did surprise me, having been to"
30,I was fortunate that I only stayed one night in Guatemala for business because this will not be my first choice of hotel. The hotel is a bit outdated and needs to have a renovation. I got a room on the 3rd floor and I was immediately greeted by a broken cabinet door that they just left inside the room. The lights did not open on the bedside table and the first internet password they provided did not work. I called and fortunately the 2nd password connected but to only one device. I was tired so did not make a fuss and ordered room service. I ordered a relatively simple sandwich but it still took more than 40 minutes to be delivered. 
40,"Modern and well appointed. Four restaurants and lobby bar. Close to airport and zoo. Presence of security staff. Busy with conventions and meeting rooms during day, parties at night. Very friendly multilingual staff.Japanese restaurant is good but pricey. Had problems exchanging money. Two ATMs. Various shops and fitness and business center. A good hotel."
50,"We made reservations about a month before arrival.  Good things about the hotel: we were greeted by a private shuttle at the airport - free of charge with prior reservations through the hotel website.  We arrived at the hotel around 9 pm, which is not a safe time to travel in Guatemala but we didn't have any issues.  Once we arrived there was live entertainment in the lobby, there was a young man playing the piano!  The front desk gave us our cards and we went to our room.  We had a beautiful view of the city and the pool.    We decided to go to strikers, I would recommend this place over the lobby restaurant because they had a local band playing Spanish and English hits.  There food was delicious and the server was very kind.  We had a few beers and went to sleep around"
40,This hotel is located conveniently close to the airport and they provide free shuttle service to the terminal.  It is a large hotel with all the amenities you could expect from a very good hotel.  The pool is large and clean. The restaurants are pretty good if you do not want to wander out at night time.  The rooms are spacious enough and you have free WIFI.  All around it is a nice hotel.
50,"We had 2 separate stays in this hotel, in a span of one week and we both enjoyed our time here. In our initial stay, our room was clean, comfortable and cozy. Plenty of amenities that we did not expect in the bathroom. The only thing that we did not like was that we had to pay for in-room wifi since we booked a standard room but we had the room with a pool view.   Breakfast buffet was included and we were impressed. Great food and excellent selection. We also used their restaurants and also room service for dinner (they have a dinner buffet also) and we loved the food as well. Kudos to the hotel chef....  On our second  stay we were upgraded to a two-story, two bathroom, one bedroom suite and really loved it. Really nice with the same pool view. This time in-room wifi was"
50,"This is a beautiful hotel with a great staff.  In two stays here I had a room overlooking the pool and a corner room with great views of the city--I much preferred the corner room.  I didn't find the street noise to be a distraction and enjoyed the view, day and night.  I love the balcony!  The room is very comfortable, the water in the shower was sometimes TOO hot and had to be tempered with the cold, just a little.  I cannot say enough about the fantastic buffet breakfasts.  There was always more than even I could sample in one day.  The egg station turns out fantastic omelets and can handle eggs-over at whatever firmness you want--they are always perfect.  Fresh fruits, pastries, a nice variety of warm foods and some of the best coffee in the world!  My last day there, I"
50,Our stay here was exceptional!  Request a room overlooking the pool in the building with the balconies...  easy way to dry your clothes and relax at night...  very little street noise on this side of the building!  great buffet meals and excellent English speaking staff!  the large pool is warm and inviting!  I cant wait to stay at this property again!
20,"the reception area is nice. once you find put that your room is in the older part of the hotel , its not so nice. if your room faces the airport , be prepared for lots of noise but also nice views , planes taking off outside you window. the restaurants in the hotel a not good. there is a sushi restaurant , it is ok. then there is the restaurant, better not to go there. breakfast in the main dining area , a buffett or a la card, is very poor. if you lucky you can catch the attention of the waiter to serve you coffee. they have very good room rates but you have to pay for everything extra , even internet. even though i understand they have  almost the best ocupancy rate in the hotel in guatemala city, i would not go there again."
50,"I have been staying at this hotel since I was a little girl and it was called: El Dorado and now Barcelo. It has a superior staff that goes above and beyond, lots of foreigners so everyone speaks english all the amenities you would expect for the price and star rating. You will enocunter lots of families, and on the weekends lots of events happening in the conference rooms, ballrooms, bars, etc. It is definitely a great place to stay for a business trip if you want all the standard american commodities!"
50,The staff in the hotel and the restaurants was very helpful and friendly. The food at the restaurants was excellent. I highly recommend the freshly made omelet for breakfast and the famous hamburger at the sports bar.
50,I recently stayed at this wonderful hotel in Guatemala City on Superbowl Sunday preparing to fly on to Roatan early the next day. The room was immaculate. The bed was extremely comfortable. The food in the restaurant was great and the service was terrific. My wake up call came promptly at 3:00 am for me to shower and prepare for the hotel shuttle to the airport at 4:00 am. What I was not prepared for was a shower that would emit scalding hot water only. I washed up as well as I could using the sink but not being able to shower before heading out for two flights at such a fine hotel was a disappointment. Overall I would stay at the Barceló again and I would recommend it to others with the caveat that you check the shower immediately upon checking in.
50,Just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel. It was a working trip so not much time to hang out in the hotel but from the time spent there it was awesome! I was extremely impressed with the knowledge and efficiency of the front desk staff. The hotel was busy the week I was there with large groups coming and going and everything to run very smoothly.  Free Airport shuttle transfers were very helpful and timely.  Buffet in morning was delicious with tons of options and fresh cooked omelets:) Could have used a few more wait staff to help clear tables and fill drinks.   Beds and rooms were very comfortable. Used room service for a couple of meals and was pleased with service and quality/amount of food.  Over all a very nice hotel with extremely helpful and polite staff! Would
40,"Recently visited Guatemala City for business and stayed at the Barcelo.   I enjoyed my stay.  The rooms are large and the staff are very accommodating.   Transportation to the airport is included and for my visit internet was paid for.    Breakfast and dinner is very good--our hosts paid for everything, so did not spend much.   Food is fresh for the most part, although i believe some of the fruits were canned.  The pastries and desserts were excellent.  Two fitness areas, one near the lobby and one a long trek pass the pool. The fitness areas need work.  Dated equipment and not that clean--maybe it just looked that way because of the age.  May try another hotel next time, but this one was very close to the business we were evaluating,"
40,"Our Helps International mission team stays at the Barcelo after arrival from the airport and departure to our mission trip destination the next day.  The staff is used to hosting large groups and handle them well.  There are large meeting rooms, a sports bar/restaurant on site and another restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The rooms are clean, quiet, nice and the beds are comfortable.  The buffet breakfast includes many fruits, cheeses, meats, breads and other pastries as well as typical Guatemalan food and made to order omelets.  This is a nice place to stay in Guatemala City."
40,"A former Marriott has a big hotel feeling.  Rooms are pleasant.  Stayed twice and room was always in good shape and quiet.  Transportation from airport included.  Internet = $10.00 a day.  Breakfast can be included in room price for an additional fee.  It is bundled.  Arrived late, missed a day, charged for both room (understandable) and breakfast (not fair)."
20,"I have stayed here several times over the past few years.  I am a frequent traveler to Guatemala.  I don't spend time in the City except for a night before I leave the Country or the first night there.  The Barcelo is very close to the airport.  It is a clean hotel with choices of restaurants and bars inside.  Usually, I am on an upper floor, 9 or so.  This time, I was on the third floor.  I was on my way home after a brutal couple of weeks.  All I wanted was a good shower (it leaked like crazy as the side of the stall had a 1 inch gap along the side) and a good night's sleep (impossible).  I used two towels to mop up the floor after a shower.  I am sure mine was not the first leak.  I am also sure the room below mine had a water mark on the ceiling.  My biggest complaint was"
40,The Barcelo is well located - near the airport and the heated pool is hidden away in a quiet corner. The 2 restaurants are very good and they supply FREE water bottles in room to drink and make coffee. Wifi is not included and should be.
50,Barcelo is conveniently located to the airport with hourly shuttle. We stayed upon arrival and again as we departed. Our room the second stay was much nicer and further from airport noise. The common areas are nicely decorated. We had some issues with check in with confusion of reservations with family of same sur name. Most of reception staff speak English for those with challenged Spanish skills. Breakfast was excellent with good variety of selections. Would defiantly stay and recommend to others.  
40,"On the recommendation of a fellow traveler, we stayed at the Barcelo in Guat City the night before our flight back to the States. This stately hotel is safe, clean, and frankly, a bargain at $71 per night. A comparable hotel Stateside would be $200+. We had drinks and a quick bite at the poolside restaurant, and although service was slow--I had to hunt someone down after waiting 10 minutes--the salmon/avo salad was tasty. The bathroom was impressive, as was the array of free amenities, down to a loofah, sewing and shoe shining kit, and a comb. Haven't seen those in a while! Barcelo is centrally located, with decent malls within walking distance (we went to the Fontabella). The free shuttle to the airport in the morning was comfortable, and on time. I'll definitely stay here"
40,"Booked 2 king rooms with balcony for one night on the way to Antigua because of a late-arriving flight. Only 5 minutes by cab from the airport (their shuttle was not waiting at the airport with those of other big hotels so we just grabbed a taxi). We were disappointed that the lounge was closed (11:30pm, even though materials said it was open until 1) so no food or drink except for minibar. My sister's room and mine were identical--nice linens, good pillows, well furnished,  lots of space, nice bathroom amenities. The down side was that all power in the tower was going out at 10am the next day so we had to be down in the elevator with our bags by then. No discount was offered for the inconveniences (though I will say that our original booking was discounted a bit over rack"
20,"Management may have changed hands, the wi-fi is not as dependable as it usually was on my most recent visit and had issues with incorrect billing upon check out. Watch the fine print, otherwise a good hotel. Not the best, but not the worst either."
40,"Expectations were met for the Barcelo brand. One night stopover on the way to Antigua, so choose Barcelo for the airport shuttle (runs 4am -11pm daily, leaving every hour). When booking make sure to include your airport flight details, when you arrive taxi drivers will try to get your business but just be patient! The Barcelo bus and the driver with the big Barcelo sign will turn up! It's about a 10-15minute drive from the airport depending on traffic.  Good size room, two double beds, desk, chairs, outdoor terrace with sliding door, comfortable beds, in-room safe, good security, strong wifi signal throughout room, lobby and restaurant (wifi was included in my deal, not sure if it always is? Otherwise I think there is $10 charge to use). Check-in was efficient. Typical size"
40,"Lynn and I recently spent 3 nights in the Barcelo Hotel, Guatemala City at the beginning and the end of a Caravan Tour of Guatemala. 8 friends joined us. We found the hotel to be clean. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. Our room had two double beds, a desk, night stands, plenty of lighting. The bathroom was average size. We also had a small balcony.  We had drinks in the lobby lounge each night and found the servers to be excellent. Our food at the hotel was served buffet style. The hotel is just minutes away from a supermarket that readily accepts all credit cards. We felt safe in this area and wouldn't hesitate to walk on the streets around the hotel. Our rooms were on the 5th and 9th floors. The views of the city were nice. "
50,The Barcelo took care of everything...their shuttle picked my family late at night from the airport and 10 minutes later we were at the beautiful Barcelo hotel. We only stayed one night but I can say the rooms were nice and clean. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The breakfast brunch offered a good selection of delicious food.
30,This hotel is not conveniently located if you wish to walk around or visit restaurants in the zona viva.  I was misled by suggestions of such by their adds.   Additionally I could not secure a room with both complimentary breakfast and wifi.  In today's world of hotels this is not acceptable.  The food in their Restuarant was mediocre at best and close to horrible.   I rate this hotel as average at best. 
40,"Highly recommend this hotel, convenient to airport, free shuttle, great buffet for breakfast and dinner.  Stayed in an upgraded room due to being full at no cost, very excellent. Gave us box breakfast for an early departure.  Needs to add free wifi like the rest of the world."
10,"I recently made a booking snafu-- I realized within seconds of pressing the final ""book now!"" button that I had accidentally booked for a Friday night when I needed to book for a Saturday night.  Their policy is no refunds.  Well, they stuck to that policy without any understanding that I called my booking company within minutes of the transaction!  I am very disappointed that they are holding me to this very expensive mistake, when it is still a few weeks until my vacation and they are not booked out yet.  :("
50,"I speak some Spanish. It was extremely helpful that there were english speaking people that worked at the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  In general in Guatemala, there were people that would try to take advantage of you and would be dishonest when they found out that you were a tourist.  The Barcelo had plenty of security, great pool, great rooms, internet, outstanding restaurants, and most of all treated me honestly.  There were no unusual charges on the room.  Everything was as stated prior to the stay.   I stayed my first day in Guatemala at the Barcelo, and because they treated me and my guests so well, I came back at the end of my stay for two additional days."
50,"The room was nice, big, cleaned, quiet, and provided with many amenities. The balcony was pleasant. I have just one bad thing to comment about hotel : the water from the shower was cold, then hot, then cold... But at the end, not a big issue. I absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It's a nice safe place in Guatemala City."
50,"Stayed here for one night at beginning of Guatemala tour and two nights at the end of tour. Staff is very accommodating and nice. The service is quick on all levels . Rooms are modern and entire hotel was very clean .,I would suggest that you take cabs to wherever you want to go on your own and take cabs back to hotel.the taxi prices are reasonable enough. The streets are not safe for tourists to walk. We were robbed at gunpoint walking back to hotel from museum (4-5 blocks ) in broad daylight at 12:00 pm in the daytime. So please be extra careful when going out. The security people at the hotel did call the police for us and they came to hotel to take a report, this was our last day in Guatemala. The robbery of course, ruined the trip,but it was a wonderful trip and place to"
50,"stayed at the Barcelo at the beginning and end of our Guatemala adventure.  Toward the end I was looking forward to the return to the hotel almost as much as the return home!  Rooms are great, food excellent, and the most of the staff speak english.  The airport is 5 minutes away and the free shuttle leaves promptly on the hour."
40,"Nice hotel. Very close to the airport, zoo, shopping and restaurants. Nice outdoor pool and workout facilities. Buffet breakfast included. 2 restaurants and sports bar inside. Nice bar/ gathering area. Good value"
50,"It was my first visit to Guatemala and I highly recommend to visit this country with such a cultural and geographic diversity, the best in Centroamerica in my personal opinion. I was traveling on my own and I find this place very convenient first because the shuttle is included from and to the airport, very comfortable rooms and variety of restaurants. Barceló viajes is in the premises so you can arrange all your tours with them. Great experience in general and well worthy the visit above all Tikal, an extraordinary place with breathtaking views."
40,"My wife and i truly enjoyed this hotel when we stayed there.  It has the feel of a resort, with a large enclosed pool area and many amenities.  The rooms were clean and modern. Our first night was somewhat frustrating though as we were in room at the front of the hotel.  There is a nightclub across the road from the hotel, which was very noisy with bass from the music that could be felt in our bones until almost 4 a.m.  Very little sleep that night.  The staff were very accommodating and helped us change to the other side of the hotel, which proved much more quiet.  The bed in that first room was very hard, which my wife found difficult.  The second room had much better mattresses.  Our rate included the breakfast which was a very elaborate buffet.  The food was excellent"
50,I have stayed at the Barcelo many times in the last few years and have always found it to be good value for the money. The staff is helpful and friendly. Rooms are very clean and the beds are well appointed. The pool and hot tub are very good. The Sports Bar is great for lunch or a snack. 
40,stayed two nights. beautiful hotel. was disappointed to find out there wasn't at least a continental breakfast included. no worries as it's in a great location with plenty of restaurants near by.   staff was friendly. free shuttle to the airport.   gym was sufficient with weights and cardio equipment. nice pool and whirlpool. always a plus. wifi was also good.
40,"The rooms were very nice, although the beds were definitely a bit hard.  I was comfortable, but if you like a softer bed, these may be too hard for you.  The sports bar/restaurant in the hotel served tasty food and the staff was friendly.  There were some shops and an ATM on site as well."
50,"We have stayed here several times over past couple of years. Always clean, great service. Best and Safest value even compared to zone 10. When we are in city, a must stay! We ask for pool view and at least floor 7. Corner locations seem to be a bit extra quieter."
50,"Love the Barcelo. It's not a new hotel, but it has that warm, cozy, elegant and familiar feel many fine European hotels do. My family has been staying here for close to 20 years, and we will keep coming back. Food is first class. Really excellent. There is a daily lunch buffet that's outstanding. The staff are really great. They truly care about what they do, and it shows. What's telling to me is how many familiar faces I see when I return. All in all, I would highly recommend staying at the Barcelo. Unless you want the experience of staying in the newest hotel in town, you can't go wrong."
40,I stayed here for about a week with work where I was working night shift a lot. The sleep quality during the day was excellent. The breakfast was great. Room was clean.  My only small complaints were that my card kept losing its programing and the shower was a bit strange.  Good hotel and I would stay here again.
40,Excellent hotel in the Traditional style. Great restaurant and Sports Bar were very welcome in the middle of the city which was a very different place when you walked outside the Hotel gates. Recomended
40,"On a recent trip to Guatemala and Honduras, we actually spent three separate nights at this hotel. As other reviewers have indicated, the location near the airport is ideal. Our rooms were very nice (corner rooms with double balcony). The hotel staff was pleasant to deal with and the food service was good. We highly recommend the Japanese restaurant located on the main floor."
40,"We flew into Guatemala City one evening, arriving around 11:00 pm and had another flight out early the next morning (first flight to Flores) and needed a place to catch a few winks of sleep.  The Barcelo had been recommended to us by our tour guide so we booked in there.    The hotel provides free airport transportation.  Upon arrival, there was a diver waiting outside of baggage claim with our name on a sign.  He also had a list of all the Barcelo guests that were due to fly in that evening, what flight they were on and it’s estimated arrival time.  Once all expected travelers were on the bus and accounted for, it was only a few minute drive to the hotel.    The shuttle back to the airport runs every hour from around 5:00 am.  It’s a good idea to give them your name and which"
50,"This hotel is located close to all corporate buildings, good breakfast, all the service is great, massage is really relaxing, be careful if you take the last massage of the day, at the end I was really sleep and the therapist just let me there sleeping, until the cleaning service guys entered and wake me up, jajajaja good massage!!! "
40,"This is a very nice hotel for a travel though.The wait staff is attentive, and most speak good English and Spanish.  The beds are a little hard, and the business office is difficult, but there is free wifi in the rooms, a variety of restaurants, pool, hot tub, attractive garden and grand stair case for good measure.  For the city, and the money, it's very good."
40,"We stayed here the night before we flew to Flores and again the night before we flew back to the U.S. Since our stays were only a day apart they were nice enough to let us store our luggage there since we couldn't take it all on the plane to Flores, that was really nice and convenient. The hotel is very large with several restaurants, a salon, a gym, and the biggest pool I've ever seen at a hotel. Everything was very nice but I was surprised they didn't offer free WiFi, for the price and quality of the hotel I would have expected it."
50,"Great Service, facilities but you should work on your internet service. Breakfast service is great and the rooms are premium. Having a zacapa at the en dog the day in the lobby bar is quite an experience."
50,"We stayed here our first night in Guatemala and what a way to be welcomed to Guatemala! First things first, they have a shuttle that picks you up from the airport. Then we check in and the front desk staff was beyond nice and very accommodating. Our room was beautiful, clean, and spacious. The next morning we had breakfast at the hotel and it was a feast! Everything we tried was amazing and the servers never stopped smiling. Enjoyed every part of this hotel and will be staying here if I ever return to Guatemala City!"
50,"What a Hotel ought to be!  This is a very well run hotel. Rooms are comfortable. Pool is heated and the hot tub is big. Full spa, hair dresser, fitness center, racquet ball etc is all there conveniently located. Free WiFi. Breakfast is complimentary with a nice selection of dishes including some typical Guatemalan preparations. La Vista restaurant offers a great menu with equally great tasting dishes. Striker Bar offers typical American fare. There is a Japanese restaurant  as well which I did not go to. The lobby bar has a delicious Peach Melba smoothie type of a drink. Most impressive of all is the high level of service. Service from the restaurant servers to the front desk is simply flawless. Most impressive was the fact that the Business Center was able to get me my"
40,"We stayed here before and after our tour with Gate 1 Travel.  It was a great place to spend a little extra time relaxing.  The pool was wonderful, even when it was raining.  The spa was great and Gladys is a FABULOUS massage therapist.The hotel staff was very helpful and kind.  The breakfast was amazing! The property is beautiful.  There is a mall, grocery store and several restaurants within walking distance.  I would highly recommend it as well as the tour by Gate 1 Travel.  It's a wonderful country but not necessarily one you would want to take on yourself since it's not totally safe."
40,I have been many time here. It is always good. Just the old carpets should be taken out of the rooms. That is not state of the art anymore. Brakefast is great here. Internet is a good cash cow for the hotel that is not aceptable anymore in my eyes in 2014....
50,"This hotel has friendly , professional and knowledgeable staff who make you feel welcome. There are several nice shops with different items at reasonable prices. The pool area is nice but not too big. Several restaurants, drug store, grocery within short walking distance. Strikers Sports Bar is lively and the food is good. I did not try the restaurant. Rooms are large and comfortable. "
50,"Convenient shuttle to airport, very clean, reasonably priced...  This will be our new ""last night"" hotel on our way out of Guatemala.    Had room service, a hot shower, slept in a comfortable bed, and would have enjoyed the inviting pool and hot tub had we been staying longer than 24 hours."
40,"For the money, you cant beat Barcelo. Shutttle is nice and prompt. Breakfast buffet is great. A very classy hotel. Very safe in the Hotel, but as in most places in Guate City, not good to walk around the city as a westerner.."
50,"This was a real gem in the middle of the city and very close to the airport without airport noise.  We were part of a Caravan Tour and stayed at this hotel 2x during our 10 visit to the country.  The pool was so refreshing,  the rooms were very clean and spacious, but the restaurant was the best part.  They had the best buffet that I had ever been too for both breakfast, and again at dinner. I would recommend everyone to stay at this lovely hotel if every in Guatemala City."
50,"Tips-  you need your hotel key to use the elevator, and to turn on the lights and AC...ask for an extra key that you can leave in the slot.  Beautiful Hotel right in the center of Guatemala City.  Just a few minutes from the airport.  Rooms were beautiful, with a great shower (be careful, the water gets hot!) Nice toiletries set out, robe and slippers in the closet.  Great views of either the pool or the city.    Breakfast buffet features local faire as well as some American food.  Staff were EXCELENT, and most speak at least some English.  Business center is helpful.  There is also a sports bar in the hotel as well, and a beautiful pool."
40,"2 stays in 7 days as rest stop hotel in city near airport. First stay got upgrade room on 10th floor in north tower, great large room with king bed. Shocked at amenities in room plus quality of wifi. Great buffet breakfast included, wear dress shirt or no entry. Shuttle on the hour was on time easy to find both coming and going to airport. Classy all the way until return trip, got south tower, still great stuff in room with balcony but plumbing was horrid. Toilet & shower were very poor, no maintenance man on duty no offer to switch rooms. This was only draw back to otherwise very nice hotel. Heck just to mention for those who can't do without a little taste of USA, MacDonalds Burger King KFC Pizza Hut all within a block. If your early riser then the 6am flights from airport jet"
50,"Great hotel…very friendly to tourists, VERY safe, though the wi-fi isn't the best in hotel rooms, but you can get speedier service in the lobby.   Food however, is expensive. You order and you are paying American or Euro prices…pretty typical for any hotel around the the world, whatever the market will bear.  Just when you book your reservation, make sure it clearly states you're getting a breakfast as well…the buffet is superb, the foods are safe and I'll venture to guess, the hotel does a darn good job of filtering its water so one doesn't suffer from any ill affects.   Easy walking distance to most localities (during the day mind you) and the uber-chic ""Oakland Mall"" is about 1- 1/2 miles walk through some decent neighborhoods.    They also offer airport service; on the half"
50,"After two hours of driving and being totally lost we grabbed the closest hotel to airport. Turned out to be best hotel stay we have had in a while. Front desk staff   Andrea spoke perfect English was an awesome delight.  Extremely efficient, helpful and went out of her way to make us feel at home. Rooms are a good size very clean and tons of hot water, the water pressure nearly knocked me over. Good price would recommend to anyone."
40,"I stayed in this hotel for a week.   You don't have access to the small fridge in your room, unless you pay extra. The wi-fi doesn't work too well. The people is very nice and are always eager to help. Food is excellent. I think they don't have room service, Im not sure. Is a quiet hotel, has good function rooms, The beds are comfortable, bathrooms are cleaned well. It only includes the room and the utilities they put in the bathroom."
50,"Secured, clean comfortable, classy, best massage, great service.  I stayed t this hotel for two days and I don't think I will stay at any other hotel in my future business trips to Guatemala. The staff are very courteous and very professional."
40,I stayed for two days and it was good. Location is perfect in one of the nicest zones of Guatemala City. The restaurant offers variety and the two gyms are well equipped. Rooms are very quiet for a good sleep.
50,"The Barcelo is a great hotel as well as a chain ( I've stayed  in the one in Costa Rica too. ) Wonderful staff. Three restaurants. Under ten minutes to the airport. The temp of the hot tub and pool are in perfect sync. There's even a phone n the bathroom. My room had two walls of windows and two balconies- ask for an end room. Only noise is an occasional jet. Street rooms have great views of mts. Solarium area is featuring blue calla lilies. Just wish the cost of wifi was less, but hotel is very reasonable for all it offers. Best bet in GC."
40,The Barcelo in Guatemala is where I always try to stay. The cost is very reasonable with breakfast buffet included. It is a quick trip in and out from the airport and security around the hotel is good. My organization has also used the hotel for seminars and we generally get a good rate. I consider the hotel to be the best accommodations for a good price in the city.
50,"One of the best Barcelo properties close to the airport. We booked early and had a 2 digit room rate. Hotwire uses this hotel too. Great business hotel. Lots of helpful information at the business center desk. Maps available with directions to the three malls. Walk along 16th street or take a taxi. Zona 10 is pretty safe to walk. Lots of great restaurants. Budget traveler's check out the large taco bell. Fine dining go to Saul for dinner or cafe San Martin for lunch. Hotel offers wifi for an additional charge. Free print out of check in stubs.   Large pool and heated Jacuzzi with pool service. Everything you need. Continental Breakfast starts at 5 a.m., the breakfast buffet starts at 6 a.m. for Q 130. highly recommended for less then $100! MeuterMedia"
40,"A good hotel, good restaurant, good breakfast, nice pool, large comfortable rooms, but avoid smoking floor the smell is terrible. Driving to the hotel leaving the airport is a bit complicated and confusing, but fairly close.."
30,"Stayed here during a transit to Antigua. Pros: Proximity to airport- quick 10 min ride. Since we arrived quite late, that was nice. It's a gated compound and very secure. Large rooms. Helpful staff.  Cons: In the daytime, you can hear the planes! Rooms are outdated. Could use a face lift and modern touches. The carpet looks like a 1960s print. Linens were not spectacular. Have stayed at other Barcelo properties so expected better. Breakfast was expensive and not that great.  I would probably  not return. Not worth the hype!"
30,"I stayed at the Barcelo for three nights and was extremely impressed with the helpfulness of the staff.  Unfortunately I needed the staff's assistance quite a bit when my room key would not work repeatedly in the elevator to access the floor of my room and also did not work in the electric reader in my room.  The rooms were very clean but beware the cleaning staff starts early in the morning around 8:00 and will try to access your room.  I thankfully could not hear other rooms but this could be attributed to my toilet that ran for 15 after each flush and blocked out all sound.  The location of the hotel was fantastic with a 10 minute drive to the airport.  To use the airport shuttle, email them your flight information for pick-up.  This does not guarantee they will wait for you"
10,"I stayed at Barcelo hotel at Guatemala city from August 4th - August 7th 2014., I made partial payment by card and partial payment by my international travel card ,Initially they blocked USD 385.49 (which includes Q 500 extra to cover additional expenses during my stay) on my travel card and finally while checking out they again deducted USD 319.04 from my travel card. Now when I received my card statement, it is showing two debits made against my travel card instead of one with different amounts. One for USD 319.04 (actual amount to be debited) and other for USD 385.49 (which was reserved earlier). There is an incorrect debit entry of USD 385.49 which has to be reversed. I am waiting to get my money back. This is very unprofessional from Barcelo hotel Guatemala city and looks"
40,"It was a nice hotel, the location is good but you are far away from the nightlife, nothing a cab wouldn't solve, the price is reasonable for the type of hotel, the rooms are of decent size, it was clean and the staff is friendly.  The only problem was the currency exchange issue, we were a group of 50 people and they didn't have enough cash, even tough I talked to them 4 hours before the other 40 people came in they were not able to help us that day but they were able to help us the next day.  If you are not afraid to walk a couple of blocks you can get to a shopping and to a great Italian restaurant that has a an amazing pizza and it's chap too.  Good experience."
50,"Stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City during a business trip to Guatemala.  The staff and service was top notch.  Was upgraded to a suite on the 12th floor that had a spiral staircase to the bedroom on the 13th floor (the equivalent of two regular hotel rooms).  The rooms was well apportioned and quiet.  The beds were a little hard for my taste.  The room rate also included breakfast at the hotel restaurant, where there was an enormous buffet set up.  If I have to go back to Guatemala City, I would definitely stay at the Barcelo again.  I highly recommend the Barcelo for anyone traveling to Guatemala City."
10,"During my visit in Guatemala the only downside was Hotel Barcelo. Starting from the check-in I experienced terrible service.   TERRIBLE customer service; They allegedly gave me complementary internet access when I upgraded my room with a balcony, which was a complete lie. Not only did the ""superior"" room not have a balcony but at the check out they wanted to charge for the internet access.    I ordered room service and there was an extra $4 charge for the food to be taken to the room. There were no drinks included in the ""complete"" breakfast menu.  I DO NOT recommend Hotel Barcelo."
50,"Stayed one night after a long bus journey from Rio Dulce ready to catch our flight home and had a comfy night in clean accommodation. Powerful, warm shower. Nice swimming pool and the ladies changing room (which was not sign posted at all?) looked really nice with a steam room and sauna. Restaurant food was very good for a buffet which are notoriously dodgy and breakfast was very nice too. Friendly, helpful staff with excellent English and a good free shuttle service to the airport made our stay very enjoyable."
40,"This is fairly close to the airport and a great stay if you need to get there early. This was actually my first stay at a Barcelo and has me hooked looking to stay at more.  Very clean and great service. It inst really surrounded by entertainment, but I was there for work."
30,"We stayed with a group of people during an event which was held at this hotel - here are my experiences.  Booking: I had send an inquiry by email and as their reply was not immediate, I booked the rooms through expedia.  In order to take the complimentary shuttle, I had advised my arrival time by phone to get picked-up at the airport. Upon arrival, no bus was there - I had to wait for aprox. 20 minutes. The transfer from the airport takes aprox. 5-10 minutes; it´s conveniently located.  I expected a more modern hotel - some of the areas are a bit outdated. The air fresheners in all areas are pestering: artificial smell everywhere.   The size of the room was OK, although the view and the noise of a pump outside my room were a bit annoying. The carpet in the room was smelly  - not"
40,"Everything was excellent, the buffet in morning, the dinner and the desserts, the service at the front desk.  Only complaint, too many security guards just standing and doing nothing!  I was stopped maybe because of my skin color and because I had a back-back (looking like a mochillero) and was asked to prove if I was staying the hotel. I bet they do this to a lighter skinned guests. Another time, my hands were full of food whI was kaing to my room, I asked one the many security guards to help me press the elevator button, he asks me to show my room key! I replied in Spanish which I'm fluent in, at this time with my hands with two platefulls, I'm not going to steal from any rooms!  More training is required for the gaurds."
40,"We spent 5 nights in one of the 2-story suites. The view from our room was spectacular and the room was spotless. Awesome upscale place to hold small business meetings in both the room and in the beautiful lobby bar. Great laundry services, great staff, great amenities including the breakfast buffet. Located in a secure area of town, we were able to wander the streets and checked out the local mall which was a great experience. WARNING: crossing main streets is not for the faint of heart! Would gladly recommend the Barcelo to other travelers and you can bet we'll stay there again..."
50,"Barceló is a hotel located in the 10th area of Guatemala City, a district close to the airport and where the main hotels are located. It is a relatively safe area of the city. The hotel is totally safe, constantly watched by security staff at all areas. The rooms are spacious, conservatively decorated, following the American standards for top hotels. Barceló offers some extra services that add value to the hotel: free high-speed wifi, free transport from/to the airport, a very convenient heated swimming-pool. Breakfast buffet was rich and varied offering different North American and Guatemalan food, delicious in any way. The prices of the rooms are very competitive compared with other top hotels in similar cities. I think Barceló is an excellent choice for those travelling or"
40,"Barcelo Much bigger than the princess Very nice large pool that is very warm Main restaurant has excellent breakfast buffet, with large number of options (great juices, custom omelettes etc.) Dinner restaurant also has buffet, but is expensive $22 a person, half price for kids 11 and under, The sports bar has cheaper prices, but ended up being very expensive primarily due to kids drinks.(Pizza Hut, KFC and McD are one block away)  Mostly good service, however, they kept bugging us about whether we had purchased breakfast for 2 or 4, (We had purchased for 4, but said several times we only purchased 2, but then always said it was ok) I think this might have be related to the fact that we booked on expedia.  We were a group of 10 over 3 rooms. At 9pm on the last night the front"
50,"We have visited friends in Guatemala several times and have stayed at the Barcelo on occasion. Our recent room was a first rate corner room, king size bed, and a balcony with great views of distant volcanoes.  The friendliness of the staff, the upscale ambience, the pool, and location made for a great stay. But the breakfast buffet was  what sets this hotel a notch  above other first class hotels. Impressive wait staff, many American and Guatemalan food items, eggs cooked to order by a great chef, fruit, 7 kinds of fruit juice, and a pleasant porch dining experience overlooking the pool started mornings in a great way. If you are looking for a first class hotel at a reasonable price in Guatemala City, then the Barcelo is for you. "
50,"I was first impressed by the ambience of the hotel when I walked in the first time.  This property is beautiful.  There were many people there to serve the clients.  The food in the dining room was quite delicious and bountiful.  The rooms were extremely nice, with large beds, plenty of pillows, and plentiful amenities in the bathroom.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Guatemala City."
50,"I live in Guatemala, my parents came to visit and we decided to stay at the Barcelo since they had a good experience in their last stay there. It was great!    I stayed on the top floor, the rooms were clean and beautiful, bed was firm, service was excellent, breakfast was wonderful, pool was warm and Jacuzzi hot.    The only things I can say as a negative:  The bathroom door cannot be locked, but that didn't bother us any.  Also, the air conditioner in our room made a rattling noise, kind of like a fan.  My parents were on the 8th floor and didn't have any issues with their air conditioner though.  Since it didn't bother us (we sleep with a fan on at home) I didn't complain.  The staff is so friendly and efficient they would probably have switched our room if I had complained. "
50,"The stay was very nice. Buffet well stocked with fresh local food,breakfast made to order.Room was very nice,modern,well stocked for a traveler .in room coffee,robes,hairdryer,tolietries,Caravan uses this as a start and finish stay because they are so efficient."
50,I stayed for five nights at the Barcelo.  This was my second visit in two years and I am even more impressed than the first time.  The front desk reception was fantastic.  Jorge  was wonderful upon check in. He assisted in finding the right room for me and I wound up with a great room in the tower wing on the 6th floor. What an accomodating professional. The Barcelo staff is top notch! The breakfast buffet in the morning is also fantastic.  What a huge selection of hot and cold items including a vast array of fresh fruit and pastries.    A quick note if you need a hair salon close by there is a great place on 14 calle 7-1|3 zona 9 two blocks from the Barcelo ----Estetica Unisex Egos is the best place to get your hair done in  Guatemala city! Reasonable and a fabulous job!!!!!! 
50,"Barcelo Guatemala City is the perfect stay! it is close to the Aurora International Airport and to the great Zona Viva area with plenty of good restaurants, clubs and excellent entertainment.  The hotel staff is great! Great service and an incredible breakfast. On my next trip I will not hesitate to stay here again!"
10,We just arrived from a long trip from the airport and they said they had no system and that they could not give us our room wich is prepaid and to leave and to call tommorow for a refund or date change he did not offer a complimentary meal or help on finding another hotel. Nothing!! NADA! my husband pissed of and a really nice man near the lobby told us its crap this guy simply does not know how to do his job and that they indeed should give us a room even if there is no system So my husband talked to the guy and demanded our room. So we are waiting now for the rooms. And very pissed of and tired!! He now says to wait 10 minutesm there is also a woman who has been wating for 2 hours!!! Last time i stay here!
50,A short ride from the airport and in the middle of downtown. I walked into an impressive hotel lobby. The check-in was easy and the clerk was pleasant and helpful. The room was very nice and the bed comfort could not have been better. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip. The hotel restaurant was good but was also able to walk to several other very good restaurants at night.
50,"We stayed there for a week in May and I can say we felt safe in the area and with the staf on point at all times of the day and early mornings, the lobby was very impressive the resturant was outstanding and the breakfast buffet was very good the pool was nice to come back and relax in."
50,"I stayed at Barcelo Hotel for 3nts on a holiday, I've stayed there previously but this time the quality of service was above and beyond my expectations. The restaurants, the food, the preparation and the cleanliness was as impeccable as any 5star hotel. I was able to speak to the head executive chef Nina Aldana Garcia, hats off to her for her professionalism and experience in keeping a unique food quality and selection for business and vacationing travelers.  The location from and to the airport is just 10 minutes away, the hotel provides complimentary shuttle service. I recommend anyone this hotel for pleasure or business!!"
40,"We stayed at the Barcelo in Guatemala City for a week in June.  I was apprehensive traveling to Guatemala as I had heard about increasing violence there.  This hotel was very secure.  We felt very safe and enjoyed our stay there.  The breakfast buffet was wonderful. Great food and we loved the patio seating.  Their outdoor swimming pool was fantastic.  We enjoyed laying out in the sun and swimming.  The bedrooms are nice and do have firm beds.  They provide many amenities other hotels do not.   Toothbrush, razor, bath sponge, and more!  They also leave two water bottles everyday for your consumption.  We would most definitely stay at this hotel again!"
40,"We stayed here on two separate occasions while passing through Guatemala City and each time we had a good experience.  This is a very nice hotel.  Both times we were given a room in the older main part and both rooms were well furnished and in good condition.  The bed was firm, but OK. I was amused at the array of ""useful"" disposable items in the bathroom, but the actual toiletries consisted of nothing but the very basics - soap and shampoo, no body lotion.  We loved the outside breakfast area and the breakfast buffet and the service was excellent. The waiting staff were very pleasant and friendly and always made an effort to have a small conversation.  Our hotel deal included free wifi which seemed to work fine and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
30,"I stayed 2 different times in 2 different rooms in the Barcelo. First room was in the main tower, and it was VERY nice. Clean and comfortable room, and a very large bathroom. Second room was in the secondary tower, and was a far step from the first visit. Room was clean, but bathroom was small and unkept, with towel bars falling off the wall, and a shower door that you have to crawl INTO the tub to turn on. And don't start the shower itself until you get inside, or you will get water ALL over the floor from the spray shooting off the open door. AND in the second room there was this extremely annoying undertone sound that I was worried would give me a migraine.  Nice attributes: small room amenities were plenty, with EVERYTHING you can think of right there, from"
50,"Just finished a four day meeting at the Barcelo and cannot say enough about the wonderful service the hotel provided.  We had 600 people attend and they catered to our every needs.  Thank you Aury, Luz, Adolfo and the rest of the staff for the great experience."
40,"We only stayed here one night before our flight out and it was perfect for that purpose. We had a room with a balcony. Room was decorated about on the line of a nice Holiday Inn Express. Good, maybe too good, hot water but shower door leaked water all over the floor. Bottle of water in the room,  chair, good lighting and great wifi. (free with our booking at Booking.com) They run a free shuttle to the airport hourly starting at 4:00 am. Restaurant reasonable with good chicken soup. American Airlines office on lobby floor so was able to check in and get boarding passes and then was able to bypass lines at airport and go straight to check in bags. Really handy."
40,Good hotel.  Close to airport and mall in Zona 10.  Great restaurants are also nearby in Zona 10.   Service was excellent from Reservations to Check-in to Restaurant staff at breakfast.  I would stay here again.
40,"Stayed here a night  before heading up to Xela the next morning.  The suite with spiral staircase to the bedroom above was well appointed and pleasant.  The hotel is about four blocks from a nice mall in Zone 10 if that appeals to,you.  A few restaurants in Zona Viva are about this distance away as well.  The hotel itself is well- secured and offers some dinng options including a sports bar if you would prefer not to venture out.  The business center at Barceló was most helpful in helping me to resolve some ATM issues via phone back to the states. Altogether, my stay here involved no negatives. Just note that there are other less expensive options in this area that are also acceptable if you are transitioning from the city to other locations in Guatemala."
50,"10 minutes from airport, this hotel is safe, friendly, nicely appointed, comfortable with ample meeting locations, opportunities.  The food flavor and variety were terrific. Very friendly employees.  Most employees speak a little English."
40,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel over the weekend since we had an early flight out. I can't comment too much about the area since we didn't spend much time there. It is close to the airport though. The price was right and it was convenient. It could use a little bit of updating, but it was still very comfortable. I would stay there again if I had to take an early flight."
40,"We have stayed here many times and they are always very professional and friendly. The breakfast is always a treat and the pool and other facilities (workout, yoga) are top notch.   on this visit they had quite a problem with their keys... but it was obvious that they were working on a solution with all due speed.  Just a minor annoyance. We will continue to stay here when we are in GC."
50,"Loved this hotel. Was only here for one night but after 3 weeks of traipsing around Guatemala, the Barceló had the best bed. When I got to the hotel, they had upgraded me, free wifi and front desk was so helpful and polite when helping me figure out how to get the lights to work (apparently you have to leave the key in, I kept taking it out. They probably thought I was an idiot but were patient with me). When I go back to Guatemala, I intend to stay longer @ this hotel so I can use the pool which looked huge from my room. Highly recommend."
40,I have stayed here a few times when in Guatemala City. It's a nice hotel close to the airport with nice amenities. It has a great pool and the hotel is safe and clean which is huge anywhere in this area of the world. 
20,"The room itself was perfect. Sparkling clean, large and cosy. Breakfast was outstanding.  Do not like it: Charging 15$ a day for wifi in the hotel of that rank is quite absurd. During our trip we stayed in many hotels of different ranks and in none of them we had to pay for wifi, most of them actually offered hi-sped internet. Also we weren't able to open the refrigirator in our room. We also didn't like the attitude of the receptionist. When we asked her some questions about getting around and out of Guatemala City she just sent us to the payphones. Also we didn't like the awkward feeling we got as everyone was staring strangely at us when we arrived to the lobby with our backpacks (the only exception were the security guys who all smiled and said hi and the waiters at"
40,"Just left the Bercelo and had a great night there.  It's not right on top of all the commercial stuff and restaurants but safely walkable. Michelle was especially nice and helpful. She found us a place to eat, taxi and all the bells and whistles.   Though I didn't stay long,  the Barcelo I did experience, was wonderful. "
50,"I selected this hotel based on opinions in Trip Advisor (#2) and I could not have made a better choice for my first visit to Guatemala. Since the check in, that was very fast, with a very nice and competent employee everything worked very very well. The room was quite nice: large, with plenty of space to store our belongings, clear, quiet and with a nice view. The bathroom was ample, with all amenities and every device worked well. The cleaning is quite good too. In the first day, I asked for more towels and every day more towels were placed with no need for asking. I don’t remember of any other hotel where this could have happened. The breakfast was excellent with a huge variety of foods. As we had many tours scheduled, in the evening, we were tired to go out for dinner and we"
40,"Very frightening neighborhood but the hotel has everything you need.  Workout room, pool, restaurant, great staff.  Excellent and clean rooms.  Great free and fast internet.  Enjoyed the cultural stuff, carved wooden masks and a huge colorful rug in the lobby.  Staff all speak excellent english."
50,"This hotel has everything you would want without havkng to leave the hotel. The hotel is ventrally located and it is easy to get to any pary of the city by taxi. If you are taking a taxi, I recommend having the hotel call a yellow taxi.  There is a minimum but it is worth using them over the taxis atthe hotel."
50,"The rooms were wonderful and clean, clean, clean! I like a hard mattress, so I was happy with the bed and slept really well. The shower in the bathroom was nice and there was plenty of hot water. The ""La Vista"" restaurant has an excellent breakfast buffet and I'm told the dinner buffet was good, too, but I preferred to order from the menu for dinner. Best tortilla soup I have ever had and the coffee was terrific. The waiters were always pleasant and attentive.The hotel also has a Kyoto Steakhouse, but I didn't eat there. It looked nice, though. United Airlines and American Airlines have offices in the hotel which made it convenient to get your boarding passes before heading to the airport.The hotel has a free shuttle to the Guatemala City airport. There is also a travel agency"
40,"10 minutes from the airport, the hotel has comfortable, spacious rooms with excellent WiFi. The beds are slightly hard; but not enough to detract the weary traveler from sleeping. The bathroom is loaded with toiletries for both men and women alike--just be careful when using the hot water--it will blister you if you aren't careful. The shower runs hard and fast, the hair dryer is dated and slow.  My trip was quick, so I ordered room service. The tortilla soup is awesome! The staff is kind and helpful, and attributed to making my brief stay a pleasant one."
10,"checked into the Barcelo for our last night after spending a great two weeks in Guatemala. I had stayed at la inmacculada on my first night in and it was absolutely lovely. We decided to stay here because it was $20 cheaper and close to the airport. Night and day. José at the front desk had no problem holding out check in back by 25 minutes because he couldn't find out reservation (even though I showed him my expedia email confirm and related booking numbers etc. right away). after finding the reservation he the. kept us waiting to confirm we had indeed prepayed the room despite it being clearly noted in the email. Admittedly, we had just flown in from Flores and were tired but common courtesy after such a long wait would be to follow up after giving us the key like I asked him"
50,"Spacious rooms, comfortable beds. Simply perfect. The swimming pool is amazing. They have a free shuttle from and to the airport.  When you put the aircondidioning it doesn't feel like in the fridge like in most of the hotels where we stayed. I would definitely choose Barceló again."
40,"We stayed in this hotel on two different nights. We spent our first night in Guatemala at this hotel and I was very impressed with its lobby and public areas. It is humongous, clean and very elegant. Check-in was a breeze, but I was a bit put off by so many male employees dressed in black with ear pieces and walkie talkies. I had booked a room with a balcony but we were upgraded and were given room 452 in the new tower. The king size bed was huge with plenty of nice, fluffy pillows. The bed itself was extremely comfortable and I had a good night's rest. I had read in other reviews about the noise level, but I didn't hear anything that kept me up. The room itself was clean, but nothing spectacular. I've stayed in many hotels and this room was no different than any other hotel"
40,"This is a good stay. The neighborhood is safe, the rooms are nice, large, and clean, and the breakfast buffet is pretty oustanding.  We were here for two different nights. On the first one they upgraded us to a suite (very posh) and the second time was a regular room with two double beds.  There is a good grocer just around the corner that is a good place to grab some easy and cheap food."
40,"I spent a night there recently. The hotel has been updated and remodeled recently and it shows. The rooms are spacious, clean and well kept. The breakfast buffet is good and reasonably priced. The swimming pool is clean though it seem like it had a shortage of chairs. The hotel is usually pretty busy, it is conveniently located, it is only a few blocks away from La Zona Viva, where you can find nice places like Fontabella a very nice shopping center which offers a wide variety of restaurants. Though zona viva and Fontabella are both within walking distance this is Guatemala, people drive to travel one block, so if you want to do like the locals do, take a cab to Fotabella and then walk around zona viva where you can find Hard Rock Cafe for all you HRC fans! The hotel is a very"
50,"I stayed in the hotel few times, the rooms are clean and staff is happy to help you and friendly. Breakfast buffet  have a nice selection,  fruits, breads eggs dishes and yogurt  I always feel very safe."
40,"Thank you in gate1, for the trip , the hotel was very good and the guide the best to explain everything, I will always travel with gate 1 because is very good and affordable, all the people on their trip are fun . till th enext time ......"
50,"This was our second visit to the hotel and it didn't dissapointed us. Rooms are spacious and confortable, staff is very friendly and helpful, and both the breakfast and the dinner buffet are as good as ever."
50,"A stayed here a combination of two nights, one at a time. The hotel is very inviting, has multiple restaurants, two gyms, pool, sauna, steam room, and a few bars. Staying here is like a vacation in itself. The price is very reasonable as well. The hotel is located in a business district and has a bunch of other restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are clean and modern. The bathroom is very nice and has a bunch of different bathing products not offered by most hotels. Also don't forget to get the breakfast. One of the best hotel breakfast's I have had!"
50,"I have been a Customer for the las four years at Barcelo hotel Guatemala city and Travel all over the world. But Barcelo hotel Guatemala is the best!! I love to talk to people and ask question about the hotel and the country where i m. As a result, hotel Barcelo, becomes to be my favority. Never heard any or seen a costumer unsastify. In addition, the security is friendly and very polite. The hotel has two restaurants with very excelent Manu plus a hiuch sport bar with fantastic atmósfera."
40,"My wife and I spent five nights in this hotel, located close to the airport, in a new area of Guatemala City. The room, facing the pool, was spacious, very clean and quiet both night and day. Windows and balcony door are soundproof, once closed you will never hear a thing. Staff is very polite and helpful. We booked our excursions weeks ahead from the hotel's travel agency. Prices are very good and most of the tours are private. Thank you very much Karina Coj from Vacaciones Barcelo for being so nice and helpful. We took three tours: Antigua/Guatemala City, Tikal and Lago Atitlan. Please, ask for Jose Ruiz, the guide. He is one of the best and you will have a great time.  Guatemala is a very beautiful country with very nice people. If you like Latin America, Guatemala it's a"
40,"The Hotel Barcelo, Guatemala City, is well suited for American travelers. A little bit of elegance and a lot of charm! Nice rooms, good food and attractive lobby, make this hotel, which is gated, a perfect place to stay in GC."
40,"What can I say about Barceló other than they set the standards for all other hotels to follow. I chose the Barceló in Guatemala City due to the fact that I am a member of the hotel chain, and they have again proven to me why they are one of the leading hotel chains around the world. I checked in already knowing the room type I wanted (smoking with a balcony). The Barceló bus was there waiting for me at the airport. My room was to initially be on the 9th floor but due to the fact the rooms was not ready the front office asked me if I wanted to look at a room on the 6th floor.  I did and stepped out on the balcony to see the hustle and bustle of the city street below and the mountains in the distance. Needless to say I chose the room and was entirely satisfied. For those who"
40,"Arrived late evening as part of a small organised group tour. A large city centre hotel which had a well laid out reception and the staff were quick to check us all in. Our room was well laid out, clean, well equipped, great beds and a very good bathroom with lots of those little extras you need when you haven't time to unpack properly. Check out was also efficient and they helped to repair a broken suitcase.  Only 8 hours so obviously not a comprehensive insight but I was impressed. We only had the 'packed breakfast' which was average so cannot really comment on the  real thing."
50,"My Fiancé and I had the please of staying at the Barceló Guatemala City in January and March of 2014.  From the moment we arrived it was clear to us that we were going to be taken care of like kings.  The staff was always helpful, even when not asked.  They could sense a need for help and jumped right in.  Nothing we asked for ever left us feeling like we were putting anyone out, actually we always felt like they were patiently waiting for us to make a request.  We enjoyed the dinner and breakfast buffet and we overwhelmed with the selection and quality of the food.  Staff constantly cleaning the buffet area making for some great meals.  Being from Orlando Florida, were we to find a similar hotel and staff, the cost would be at least $250-$300 a night.  Our weekend stay in March"
50,I stayed here March of 2014.   We did not get the king room we reserved.  The room did have a great location sixth floor centered on the pool so we decided not to ask to be moved.  Flowers were one of the add ons they offered and we had selected them at the time of booking.  When we checked in they asked if we still wanted them. Shortly after getting to the room someone brought the flowers (with no vase).  So we asked for a vase but it never came. Had to use the trashcan instead. The flowers were very beautiful.  The beds were firm but I would not say they were hard. I slept very well.    Had breakfast here every day and the service was good with a nice selection of items. Also ate lunch by the pool two days and dinner at the restaurant by the pool twice.  Every time good
40,"First class hotel; large clean rooms with all the perks one expects. Great buffet meals, HUGE, Good well attended and monitored pool and gym. Not too crowded because their security ensures guests only. Service at front desk was fine with no delays. Wake up calls right on time. The pickup service from and to the airport was without delay. All in all, a nice experience. Would stay again and recommend."
40,"Lobby, gift shops on ground level very nice. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Free Wi-Fi a big plus, but had to change my password 3 times in 2 days.  Service from Front Desk and restaurant courteous but slow."
50,"Beautiful hotel in a safe area near the airport. Free shuttle service. Common areas and the room were spotless and very clean. Many amenities. Room service was prompt and courteous, as well as the front desk staff. My king-size bed suite had two levels and a great view of the volcanoes for about US$125. I will be back. I even encountered the Queen of Spain in the lobby – complete with about a dozen undercover security guards – as a I checked in!"
40,"Very convenient especially being close to airport! Restaurant was very good, and they were able to handle a very large crowd one morning when a very large group of doctors, nurses and their staff who were all in Guatamala volunteering their service to the peasants in the mountains had breakfast."
50,"We spent 10 days in Guatemala with a family and traveling on buses with a five year old and a three year old. By the end we all had a bad cold and stomach issues and we're very happy for a hotel that had everything we needed. Usually I would enjoy a more authentic cultural experience that you might get in Zone 1 I hear, but this time I was just happy to be comfortable and walk downstairs and ask for anything. The gift shop is nice for last minute buys and the Buffett was amazing. Save room for it. Free shuttle to the airport was great. Get out there early to get a spot to assure your arrival at the busy airport. It is a very fancy place and the pool is also nice. You get way more for your money so if you want a refreshing end to your trip this is a great place."
40,"We stayed here three times over a two week period as part of a Gate1 tour of Guatemala and Honduras.  The first visit we were in the new tower (no balcony) and the other stays we were in the older part of the hotel (balconies).  Charge for wifi however just to the right as you exit the hotel there is a MacDonald's with free wifi (sit near the children's play area for best reception). Buffet breakfast was very good (wonderful selection of fruit juices) and they offer a box breakfast for early departures.  Free shuttle to nearby airport as well - departs every 15 minutes starting at 5 a.m.  Just behind the bar area, there is a very pleasant sitting area which is a nice place to sit if it is not in use."
40,"This is a nice hotel with a friendly staff.  I enjoyed the room overlooking the city, with a small baloney in which to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city.  It's quite near the airport, while convenient, also means that you hear the air traffic.  The restaurant, Kyoto, in the hotel is worth trying."
40,"Stayed here 2 nights and another 1 night when leaving the country. Make sure you stay in rooms facing the pool courtyard in the new tower. Rooms are larger and view is much better and quieter. Unless you prefer a view of MC Donald's, stay in the new tower . Buffets were all top notch with lots of choices with good services. Nice pool and spa, sports bar, Japanese Restaurant, lobby bar. Supermarket is a easy few blocks away walk. Would stay here again."
40,"We stayed at this hotel for one night and were very pleased with it. This beautiful hotel is located near the airport and they run a free shuttle every few minutes. When we arrived late on Feb. 14th they surprised us with an upgrade to a suite, which was fabulous. We had a beautiful view of the city from the top floors. The room was immaculate and very well appointed. However, what we found most memorable was the breakfast, which was included in the rate. I’m not sure if they offer the buffet breakfast on weekdays. We happen to be there on a Saturday morning and were treated to one of the best breakfasts we’ve ever had. The variety and quality of all the dishes offered made me with I had a second stomach so I could have kept on trying more delicious dishes. The service in the"
50,"I stayed at Barcelo just one night before my airport departure the next morning.  For Guatemala City, this is a very high end property in zone 9 (the zones are important to consider in this city for safety reasons).  It is in one of the safest parts of the area but just off the main street so it is quiet and less busy.  I was very comfortable walking from the property through the industrial area about a mile to the big mall for some indoor walking and shopping but you can also take a taxi for about $6 USD (Q50).  Along the way, there are a number of shops, bars and restaurants (both tourist-focused an local food) and as with most of Guatemala, there are plenty of fast food options nearby for those who choose.  This is a very large property with beautiful pool area and huge main"
50,"You should try this Hotel.  So conformable.  Breakfast Buffet is delicious and plenty of a variaty of all kinds of meals.  We just stay for one night but we'll be back for more nights. Guatemala City is beutiful, many places to go."
50,"Our favorite hotel - after staying 40 nights!  Having lived and traveled many years in the USA and other wealthy countries, we have been astounded at the value for the money offered by the Barceló Guatemala City.  For the same price in the USA we'd get perhaps a 2 or 2.5 star motel in a secondary city or smaller town, with a small seasonal pool and grocery store muffins with red delicious apples for breakfast.  But at the Barceló, we get a nice room with a balcony and a view, a large heated pool of about 21 or 22 meters on the longest side, a jacuzzi (two if you count the one in the women's locker room), a fully appointed gym (three if you count the 24 hour hotel guest gym and the gym in the men's locker room), the most comfortable beds we've found in Latin America with"
30,"I have only lived here for one single night. Hotel is clean and standard. Airport shuttle is very convenient although it does not go to TAG domestic terminal. The only complaint I have is that I had pre-arranged a cab pick-up from TAG terminal via the hotel but when my plane landed, the cab is nowhere to be found. I had to scramble to find a way to get to the hotel (TAG terminal is not some place you want to be stranded in when it is getting dark and late). Honestly in Guatemala I had to do this type of arrangements through different hotels quite a few times and the no show only happened to Barcelo (I would rate it a 4 if not for this particular situation)."
50,"This was a great hotel, with a very helpful staff. It's located very close to the airport, and they run a free shuttle so that your arrival and departure are one less hassle to deal with. Very clean and attractive rooms with a large television and an in room safe. The breakfast buffet was terrific. The next time I'm in Guate City I'll definitely come back."
50,"We stayed at Barcelo two nights so we could be near the airport for early flights.  It is a comfortable, modern hotel, suitable for business travel or tourists who want a change from the smaller, more intimate lodging often found elsewhere in the country.   The large buffet and pool make it a great choice if you're traveling with kids.  Make sure you confirm airport shuttle times.  We were told they run on the half hour, but the service was hourly when we needed it."
40,I was only here for a short time and it was great.  We stayed at the hotel the day before our fligh home. We arrived before checkin time so the hotel stored our bags for us. We relaxed by the pool and they served us drinks.   We booked two hotel rooms across from each other. The rooms were a good size and had nice & comfortable beds.   We enjoyed the hotel dinner along with the hotel breakfast the following morning.  I would return to this hotel the next time I am in Guatemala City.
50,"We stay at the Barcelo now, and have found it to be the best! Rooms are clean, comfortable, and well appointed. It is true that checking in often takes a long time, since there seems to usually only be one person checking in a number of people. One time we arrived without reservations, and they kindly directed us to their business center for free, to look up the best online rates. The meals in the restaurants are very good, especially the buffet for breakfast or for dinner. We've also eaten in the Japanese restaurant, and it was really delicious, although a bit expensive. The staff in the buffet area are always helpful, especially Hugo who has helped us several times, always with a smile. "
40,"More than just enjoyable.  Ammenities far more than the usual, three restaurants (La Vista, Strikers [sport bar] , a Japanese restaurant a well as the Lobby Bar where you could have meals from any of the restaurants delivered to your table ... and room service is also available from all the restaurants.  LaVista a bit pricey.  Our breakfast was included and absolutely incredible fantastic fabulous!  You could choose anything under the sun from fresh figs to salmon in your specially created omelet.  All manner of fruit juices with and without sugar n glorious ceramic dispensers.  The  charming gift shop is independently run, is also in the lobby, carries all manner of beautiful and nicely priced Guatemalan hand made items and souvenirs.  There is an ATM in the lobby where you can"
40,We enjoyed our stay very much.  The bed was comfortable but firm.  The buffet meals were excellent with good choices and excellent flavors.  I would give this hotel excellent except they choose to charge for WIFI.  We walked in the neighborhood taking pictures and someone yelled out of a car window. Be careful.  Hotel itself was lovely.
50,"Beautiful Hotel, top notch.  Location is not the best but you can walk to Viva Zona 10 where all the hot night clubs are located.  The Bar at the Barceló is expensive but the Sport Bar, Scores, is reasonable."
40,"We checked into this hotel for one night when we arrived in Guatemala City. We were a group of 9 and had reserved 5 rooms.  There were 2-3 people checking in before our group and it was late in the evening.  The check in process was incredibly slow because there was only one attendant at the desk.  When we went to our room and opened the door, we were greeted with a strong stale cigarette smoke odor.  We immediately went back to the desk and told the attendant we could not stay in that room. He told us ""that is a non-smoking room.""  My response was ""it may  well be but someone has definitely been smoking in it"".  He then graciously gave us another room which turned out to be an upgrade.  The room we got was two levels with the living room, mini kitchen, and one bathroom"
50,"This was a one night stand while on our way to Antigua. It was recommended by a Guatemalan friend. It is close to the airport, yet we did not hear any planes. We were 2 hours late arriving - so about 12:30 am, yet the Barcelo van met us without delay and was nearly full of passengers. Unfortunately we had to get up the next day to get our transport to Antigua, which was scheduled for 10am. So, not much time to rate all the features. Great choices for the breakfast buffet, including eggs to order. It was a bit slow checking in as only one person was checking in all the arrivals. Yet the hotel must of expected this. A minor glich."
40,"Sign up for their frequent traveler program (it's called Barcelo One on One or something). They don't advertise it. You can also get Iberia frequent flyer points, but not American or Copa or Taca (like in the past).   If you're staying more than one night, ask for their exercise class schedule. Also, their laundry service will knock on your door around 8 am if you don't put the Do Not Disturb sign on your door. You can drop off laundry until 11 or so, and it comes back to you in the late afternoon.   Food is excellent, both the buffet & the a la carte, as is the room, the hot tub, and pool. I wish the shower were a little less awkward (there's no way to test the shower water without getting soaked by it).  The airport shuttle is great, but get there early because sometimes it's"
50,"This grand hotel in Guatemala City, Guatemala combines old-world charm and contemporary luxury.  The lobby is strikingly beautiful, the rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds and with all of the amenities you would expect in a 5-Star property.  You will find the Barcelo Hotel staff to be friendly, knowledgeable, and very professional.  I strongly recommend the bed and breakfast buffet option.  The breakfast selections are incredible!  For business or pleasure while visiting Guatemala City, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!"
50,"My family and I spent a week at the Barcelo Guatemala City in early January. The stay was not only enjoyable but remarkable for the professionalism of the staff. Although I'd give the hotel my own top recommendation, some people see things differently and seem to find complaints with ice-makers that make the wrong-shaped ice, or conditioner that looks like shampoo.  My own observations were not enough to compromise my judgment that it's an excellently run hotel.  My wife and I travelled separately, and my twin sons (6) and I were able  to check-in early. Without ever being rushed, we were able to kill time in the sportsbar/restaurant while we waited for my wife.  When my wife arrived, our multiple WiFi devices (iPads, laptops, Blackberries) exceeded the default limit of two per"
40,I recently visited Guatemala via Gate 1 travel (the best travel company in my opinion!) Hotel Barcelo was superb.  Their breakfast buffet was excellent and the choices were incredible. I spent the Christmas/New Year week in this hidden jewel.  People were very friendly and sincerely wanted everyone to enjoy their country.  I recommend this trip and especially with Gate1travel.com! 5 thumbs up!
50,"I usually reserve staying in the Barcelo for the last night I'm in Guatemala.  It's conveniently located close to the airport, they have a wonderful gourmet buffet for dinner ($20) and for breakfast, too. The hotel is FIRST CLASS, five dining rooms, excellent service, and free shuttle to the airport.  I love staying here! The emloyees all match the stars: 5 STAR."
40,"The key items to comment: Bed - was pretty hard and i got some sore hips and needed to turn often. Typical of asian beds and older properties, IMO. LInens are high quality. Room - had no heat as hotel is not centrally ventilated. Staff quickly brought me blanket and portable heater to solve this. This worked perfectly. Wind howled these days and the noise leaked into the window to remind me of it. Temps were much colder than normal this week.  Bath - all fixtures worked very well; shower head large and pressure very good. All gels/ shampoo/ cond were the dispenser type inside the tub. Towels were thick and large - excellent. Plentyof staff around and security men. Gym and restaurant staff all very friendly and quick to serve. Rest La Vista had nice quality food for brkfast and"
40,"Big chain hotel. Big sign. Big fence. Guards in suits. Piano guy playing cheese to hotel lobby bar patrons. I paid 85USD before taxes. Clean, big room. Early check-in (surprise) included room upgrade (whatever that meant - didn't get a balcony and didn't care).   Free wifi and hot signal.  We had a toilet issue and it was fixed in an instant and then cleaned minutes later. Lots of eating options.  24-hr room service, but I got take-out from the sports bar, which was a forgettable meal. I recommend taking a 15-minute stroll to the Aurora Zoo if you have an hour+ to kill. Some really neat species and dead cheap. This is probably the best airport hotel (at least the biggest and most to offer) that I've stayed at. However, shuttle runs every hour, which I found highly surprising. "
50,"Came to stay here for 1 day as I was leaving Guatemala (came from the highlands) and moving on to Nicaragua.  Wanted to rest up, connect online, and luxuriate in the comfort before my next leg - Barcelo did all of that for me!  Inside of the room was large enough and filled with all necessary amenities.  Have stayed around the world in some of the nicer properties and I would say Barcelo had one of the best breakfast buffet options, hands down!  Great range of options, very good quality - by itself makes the stay worthwhile.  Only thing I noticed that the wait staff were scrambling a bit, could be due to high volume during this peak time, so getting a coffee (only thing that you need to ask for) was a little time-consuming. I needed to get some information from the business desk"
50,"This is a high end hotel close to the airport. We got a great room with two balconies and check in was quick. The only issue we had was that we found out (after going to the airport) that we were going to have a long flight delay so we wound up going back to the hotel. We got back into the room before 8:30 am and the room was already halfway made up. I know that cleaning staff can start up early but they must have started at 8 which seems too early.. and we hadn't actually checked out yet. Despite this, the hotel was very nice and immaculate."
40,The hotel is close to the airport and offers shuttle service. I was there for a conference and I was satisfied with the organization and the friendliness of the staff. The buffet breakfast and dinner gave enough choices and the spa offered affordable services.
50,"I chose the Barcelo Guatemala City mainly because they offered a reasonable rate.  I had a very short stay of only one night but I wish I had stayed longer.  The hotel services are outstanding.  I used the complimentary hotel shuttle when I arrived in Guatemala and the next morning at 6 a.m. to return to the airport.  The room was very comfortable and clean,  There were many items in the toiletries tray in the bathroom that I have not seen offered at other hotels in a long time.  The staff is very friendly.  The hotel is open for a continental breakfast at 5:00 a.m. with plentiful choices of fruit, bread, cereal, cold cuts and cheese, and a varied selection of delicious fruit juices.  There is also a hot breakfast starting at 6:00 a.m. but I was gone by that time to catch a very"
20,"This hotel is not far from the airport, it's modern and comfortable, there's several restaurant choices in the hotel, and a free shuttle to the airport is offered. BUT what a headache it was to stay there!  I made my reservation on their website, but the front desk could not find a record of my reservation in their computer system. Fortunately I had brought along a printed copy of the reservation I had arranged on their website. I had to stand at the front desk for maybe 30 to 45 minutes while the clerk tried to figure things out.  I then had to wait about an hour and a half for clean rooms to become available until I could get into a room. I then had to wait another two hours until there was hot water in the bathroom before I could take a comfortable shower.  Upon check-out the"
40,"That was my first time in Guatemala and I was positivily surprised by this hotel. Reasonable price, good breakfast, comfortable room. The room is well located and the hotel is fairly close to the airport. I believe all rooms have their own balcony and the hotel has a lot of good amenities inside (shops, restaurants, etc)."
50,"We travel to Guatemala City one to three times a year and the stay at the Barceló exclusively.  There is no reason for us to stay anywhere else when considering the overall superior quality, at a comparatively affordable price."
40,"We have been to Guatemala several times for family vacations.  We love everything about the country.  We had stayed exclusively at the Westin in Zona 10 on all our previous trips. However, we could not beat the $89/night deal we got to stay at the Barcelo with breakfast included. Our room was perfect, except for the beds. They were extremely hard. Breakfast was outstanding with made to order Omelets, cereal, muffins, fruit and all your typical American breakfast fare. There was also desayuno typico (traditional Guatemalan breakfast) with plantains, rice, tortillas, black beans, sausages and of course several types of fresh squeezed juices in beautiful crocks. Our favorite was eating breakfast outside every morning under the protected, covered patio. Our room had an attached"
50,"We'd arrived a day earlier for our Guatemala Gate 1 tour and stayed at this hotel which was exquisite in every way.  Shuttle service to and from the hotel was wonderful.  Numerous amenities, room with a balcony, over the top breakfast and dinner buffets were amazing, tasty and delicious simply surpassed all expectations.  Expect fresh homemade juices, a variety of tasty selections and excellent service.  I opted for an English speaking taxi driver, Alfredo,  to take us to the Pacaya volcano at a fraction of the cost charged by tours and he took us to meet Jorge (George) who rented us horses to travel up the mountain.  It's a good way for seeing the sights, but be forewarned, I broke my ankle (as many others have done on the mountain according to the hospital doctor).  I decided"
40,"Have been in other Barcelo hotels so guess I was expecting better. Overall good, location is good and the service is good. The hotel is overall a tad old fashioned and good do well with some improvement. The lobby bar and restaurant have good overall service although they are a tad pricey. The gym is small and the pool is well sized albeit you swim for all to view."
50,"Hotel provides airport shuttle which was great since you can't trust all taxi's in Guatemala city. Shuttle runs every 15min and is free. The hotel was lovely. Clean room, comfortable king size bed, great room service! with no additional service fees. It's a luxury hotel."
30,"The Hotel need to remodel. When I check in, the first room they gave to me, the lighting system is out of function. I changed another room and the shower switch is bad and the toilet is out of use. The room has a noise of water pipe all the day (sound like snoring), not so loud but still confuse me. In the first day of my stay there is one private party hold in the salon of Barcelo and the music (hard rock) keep until 12 o'clock in the morning. I don't know why they allow this kind of party hold inside the hotel.   By the way, I stayed in this hotel several times and I don't know why they always give me the last room of the floor (In the end of corridor), it let me feel uncomfortable."
40,"Stayed here a total of 3 nights during a package tour of Guatemala.  Nice hotel, good rooms and very nice restaurant.  Didn't get out and about much so can't speak to the location, but there is a good grocery store around the corner."
50,"In Mid Nov 2013 my wife & I were on a Gate1 guided tour and per our schedule we stayed at the Barcelo three times (different rooms) for a total of four nights. All three registration and departures were flawless, the staff is super friendly and helpful. Dinner at the hotel's restaurant (three times) was excellent, as well as the included breakfast buffet. Note that their remarkable Sunday breakfast is quite popular with local families, best to arrive toward the last hour of open time. Perhaps it was because we were with a tour that on our first arrival when I inquired about WiFi they made it complimentary. On our subsequent registrations they didn't offer it but upon asking they readily granted it for free.  Best is to request a room on the higher floors and facing west so you"
40,"Good location, close to the airport and to the main shopping and restaurant area.  I stayed here dozens of time when it was the Marriott hotel, and then again several topi mess when it was bought by Barcelo.  The rooms are adequate, but the beds are very hard.  If you get a suite, be prepared for a room on the eleventh floor with a spiral staircase in your room to the bedroom upstairs.  Great views of the papaya volcano.  Fabulous breakfast buffet."
40,"The Hotel is a short distance from the airport and a few blocks from the Zona Viva. The hotel is large with 400 rooms, a business center, shops and conference rooms. The hotel provides free shuttle service to the airport. The rooms are nice but a little dated. The beds and shower were fine. The room was quiet even with planes coming into the airport. The breakfast was very good. WiFi costs about $10 a day. I would stay here again."
40,"This suited us perfectly for a night's stay after arriving on a long flight from Europe. Good service, choice of three restaurants, pool open until evening (lovely!), and a free shuttle back to the airport in the morning. "
50,We stayed 2 nights at the Barcelo Guatemala City at the end of our 15 day trip to Guatemala. The room was very confortable and we enjoyed the heated pool and jaccuzi very much. The airport is very close and the hotel offers convenient free shuttles.
30,"I stay in Guatemala City frequently for work purposes.  Just returned from 3 night stay at the Barcelo.  Room was clean.  Bed was very firm and we woke up every morning with stiff neck.  Restaurant staff was ok, not what I've experienced at other Guatemala City hotels.  Probably will never stay here again yet stay at my preferred properties.  "
40,"We stayed at the Barcelo twice in November as we were flying into and out of Guatemala City. I found an excellent price for the hotel by pre-paying on Hotels.com.  I emailed the hotel before departing to arrange a free airport shuttle pickup. Our plane arrived later than expected and when we came out of the International arrivals, there was no shuttle there to pick us up. I called the hotel and they said another shuttle would be there soon, which it was. The shuttle was clearly labeled Barcelo and we were promptly taken to the hotel for check-in. Even though it was close to 11 pm, there were lots of people checking into the hotel.  The front desk staff was very helpful and spoke very good English. Check-in was simple and I was able to exchange some US dollars for Quetzales, at a"
40,"Found this place on Trip Advisor for my business visit when other places with more international brand names were full. Boy was I blown away. The property is not too far from the airport which was a pleasant surprise especially when you did not hear the noise of the jets. The check in was very efficient and friendly with hardly a wait. The staff were all very friendly and extremely disposed to assisting in whatever way they could. The room was very nice and in fact bigger than what I expected given the price I paid which included breakfast. In fact, kudos to the chain for starting breakfast at 5:00 am (continental style between 5:00-6:00 am and buffet from 6:00 - 11:00 am). Not many hotels start breakfast even at 6:00am. The hotel is well situated with a number of external"
50,"This is a very good five star hotel: efficiant check-in and check-out, room is well equiped and in a very good condition, breakfast is very nice. There are also many restaurants within a five minutes walk if you prefer to go out."
50,"I went in January thinking a long way south of the US meant warm (hot?) weather so I booked in January.  The price was right, well below any Barcelo hotel I had ever heard of.  The hotel is wonderful.  However the weather was cool (65f) most days but the hotel pool was below street level and on the sunny side.  Everyday I could get 2-3 hrs of sun in the warm air of the pool atea.  The pool was heated and they have a large hot tub next to it. This is an old hotel in perfect condition and had more grandeur than any other I have ever stayed."
50,"We stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City at the end of October as part of a Caravan tour. Because we arrived a day early, we had to arrange our own transportation to the hotel, but that was not a problem since Barcelo offers a free shuttle from the airport. I had emailed the hotel with my flight info, asking where to find the shuttle since we weren't arriving until 9:30 at night. It was easy. We came outside, looked to the left and saw the white vans, and realized someone was standing in front of one of the vans with a Barcelo sign.  The staff was great, very helpful, and very patient with us when we had trouble getting our key cards to allow us entry into the pool area. The pool is heated and we used it every day.  The room was an average size, clean, and the balcony overlooked"
50,"Beyond any doubt an outstanding stay even without taking advantage of many of the services offered. Good location near to the airport, shopping center and many embassies. Highly recommended - I will certainly return."
40,"Barceló Guatemala City holds the best hotel gym I have ever seen. It has a complete set of aerobics and weightlifting apparel. They are brand new and working in perfect condition. Also, the hotel is conveniently located in an accessible zone and next to restaurants, if you do not feel like eating inside. Great value on the cost/benefit side."
40,Very convenient being close to the airport. In hotel restaurant serves up a great meal. Gave it a 4 instead of 5 due to the beds could have been more comfortable plus had an issue connecting to the wifi. I would definitely recommend and/or return.
50,"Maybe a bit dated and ugly from the outside but with a nice pool, well appointed rooms, parking and free airport shuttle + great breakfast within walking distance from all of Zone 9 and 10. Generic large hotel experience done well."
50,"This was a lovely hotel, I stayed here for a week for work. Hadn't stayed in a Barceló hotel before, and the rooms were very comfortable, spacious, and luxurious-feeling, good wifi connection for work. There were thoughtful little touches that made a very nice difference (who can resist welcome treats and fruits in the room?). Very nice and helpful service. Would definitely stay here again! "
50,"Recently I toured Guatemala with three different stays at the Guatemala City Barcelo so I had an opportunity to experience the facilties on three different times (weekend, end-week and mid-week).  All three stays were excellent and I would most definitately return and recommend this Barcelo.  The front desk was exceptionally friendy and helpful. The sports bar, and two other restaruants had a wide selection with reasonable prices.  The business center was courteous and very helpful in arranging for private taxi with English speaking driver to see the city since my tour company did not have that included.  Likewise, having an American Airlines facilty in the hotel made it extremely simple to check in upon departure and obtain boarding passes.  The loaction on La Reforma Ave in"
50,"We stayed 3 nights recently and absolutely loved the Hotel. The atmosphere and ambience were grand. The food bar was excellent weather for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner. The only drawback was the King size beds that were quite firm. The location was very central to downtown. The rates were average/reasonable. We would not  hesitate to recommend this Hotel."
50,"Clean rooms, comfortable beds, a safe in all rooms, and nice pool . The dinner and breakfast buffet were very good the sports bar food was so so. Located close to the airport.   Guatemala City is a beautiful clean safe place.  All of the neighborhoods in the city compete for recognition of cleanliness and upkeep."
30,"nice large clean rooms with excellent firm beds.  however lobby is 100% charmless, a business hotel at its worst, dreadful bar, so so restaurants, and if there is such a thing, too much security.  feels more like a business prison than what it claims to be -- a luxury hotel."
50,"The hotel and it's amenities and all the details they put in thinking of the guests comfort was outstanding.  The bathroom caddy has almost everything you'd find in a 5 star hotel, sewing kit, shoe hone, toothbrush and paste, beauty kit, etc.  What a surprise.  The bed was a little harder than I liked, but if I had asked they would have changed it.  Every time there was an issue someone came to the door in record time.  The lounge was beautiful and they always had entertainment such as piano or saxophone.  The breakfast was luxurious and laden with so much food.  The swimming pool was grand and the fitness center was small but sufficient.  The reception could use a little work because the wait time is a little too much, they usually have only one active person at a time.  I also"
50,"Overall an excellent hotel.  Large clean nicely furnished rooms with great beds and pillows.  Superb breakfast buffet.  The sports bar doesn' t have great food, and we didn't try the other in house restaurants.  Excellent value"
40,"The hotel is close to the airport, and within walking distance to a nice shopping mall, too. The pool is beautiful, and the fitness facilities are very nice. Lots of amenities to choose from. We enjoyed an upper floor room with balcony overlooking the front of the property. The room was clean and comfortable. The location was wonderful."
30,"A definitely plus for this hotel is its closeness to the airport. It's about 3-5 minutes way. Otherwise I found it very average, although lobby was very nice and welcoming. Front desk person was not friendly at all. The rooms were basic. A high floor is a must if visiting over the weekend, as they seem to have very loud parties and events and you can hear the loud music if staying in a lower floor. Breakfast buffet had many local and international choices. Conference facilities sand wifi were good."
50,"This is the nicest hotel with the best staff we have ever been to.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Most speak excellent english too.                                                                                                The breakfast offering is unbelievable.  I cannot think of breakfast better or more varied.  Fresh juices, the best tamales I have ever eaten, breads, omlets, sausages and bacon of all kinds, many fresh fruits, etc.   You can eat all you want from the buffet.  Security is tight and welcome in this country.   The rooms are clean, neat, modern with all conveniences. A wonderful hotel!"
30,"We got the Guatemala City from Quito, and arrived early. Were picked up from the airport, so all good there. Because we were early, our room was no ready at around 10:00 am. Clerck mentioned about an hour, so we decided to have a coffee in the seating area by the front desk. Around 11:15 I inquired at the desk via another clerk the status of our room, who immediately assigned us to an other room, which apparently was ready all along. Excellent room, spacious bathroom, nice amenities, we had breakfast both days, lots of choices from the buffet. We had dinner in the sports bar, staff seemed stressed, only one bartender but he did his best to service everyone timely. We also tried one evening the Sushi Restaurant, ""Absolutely Terrible"" Do not waste your money here. The sashimi was"
50,"I have stayed a a few hotels here in Guatemala City, but I really like this one overall. The staff was very attentive and the hotel is in a great location.  Close to the airport too.  My room was nice and clean!  It had a balcony with view of the city.  The bathroom had large amenities for shampoo, conditioner and shower gel.  I carry my own but that is always nice.  There is a very large pool that is heated.  I would stay here again!"
40,"I've stayed in Barcelo hotels in Managua (Nicaragua), 2 in San Jose (Costa Rica: Palma Real and San Jose Palacio), Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and Guatemala City. Experience is mostly the same, average everything: room comfort, service, food, etc. With the exemptions of San Jose Palacio in Costa Rica and Lina in Santo Domingo, DR, where the service is downright awful. And then comes the other exemption: Guatemala City, where service is very good and cordial. Where Barcelos stand out from the rest, is amenities. In most of them you'll probably find: a bathrobe, weighing scale, iron and ironing board, safe, radio/alarm clock, hair drier, coffee maker and coffee; as well as mouthwash, a vanity set, loofah sponge, dental kit, shaving kit, shoe shine sponge, comb, hydrating"
50,We stayed twice last year at the Barcelo Hotel in Guatemala City. I can't say enough good things about this hotel! The staff is great and most helpful. It is in a great location and security is top notch. The rooms are wonderful. Needless to say my wife and I were extremely happy with this hotel. I would return in a heartbeat.
50,"I liked a lot, the only thing is that is a little far from ""zona viva"" zona 10.... Delicious food, very near to airport,  nice pool and fitness room, they hace a cheap and nice beauty salon for ladies, loved it!"
50,"Our first Choice in Guatemala City. Booked thru my company, i have been there for 4 Nights. I did enjoyed this Trip very much, due the Hotel and it Service have been very professional and great Atmosphere there. Mostly Businesstravellers there and the Businesscenter was well outfitted. I had a Standard Room, wich was nice decorated. Good Service in their Restaurant too."
50,"From the time I was greeted at the airport until the time I left, the hotel and staff were excellent.  10 minutes from the airport.  Good food and amenities.  Gracious staff.  Friendly and helpful assistance at the check-in, concierge, and business center.  The pool area and hot tub and sauna were clean and in good repair.   I did not see any skimping at this property.  Excellent security and communications among staff as well.  Very clean.  They could use some nice ceiling fans in a few of the common areas.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
50,"I stayed at the Barcelo during a Caravan Trip this year. The hotel has:  1. A beautiful swimming pool area, with food and bar service poolside. 2. Comfortable rooms, with everything you would expect from a business hotel. 3. A delicious breakfast buffet. 4. A spacious lobby, with a nice lobby bar. 5. Many meeting and conference rooms, if you need them for a business or social function. 6. A very close proximity to the airport. It is about a 5 to 8 minute taxi ride from the terminal.  The hotel is comprised of two buildings. One has balconies, and the other one does not. I would recommend the ones with the balconies, since the weather in Guatemala is very pleasant in the evening, and it makes for a very nice time to sit on the balcony.  I would highly recommend the Barcelo for"
50,The hotel was clean and service was excellent.  i would especially like to point out the housekeepers and the security officers.  My room was well cleaned with great attention to detail.  The housekeepers always smiled and greeted me.  The Security Officers managed to make me feel safe but in a friendly manner.  They were also a good source of local information as I like to walk the cities I visit.  Overall my experience relected very well on the leadership of the hotel who have selected and trained a great group of employees.  This is where i will stay when I am lucky enough to return to the is wonderful city.
50,"While staying here, we were made comfortable and felt at ease.  The employees are wonderful, friendly, and helpful and we were pampered.  Close to the mall, a short walk to markets, including a small market run by locals which is wonderful.  A short ride to the underground market and many trips planned through the conceirge."
50,"Whenever we come to Guatemala we stay at this hotel at least for the first night when we arrive in Guatemala and the last night before we leave.  There is a lot of security at the hotel so it feels safe. The free airport shuttle is always there where its supposed to be.   the rooms are nice and comfortable.   there is an occasional roar from an airplane at night because its only a couple of miles from the airport, but its not all night.  the water from the faucets is safe to drink.  The pool and hot tub are big and wonderful, and you can use the adjoining health club (with spin classes), or the hotel's workout room.  the hotel is right across the street from a row of tourist shops, and a block or 2 from a grocery store.   It is just a few blocks (very walkable) from Zona 10 with"
30,"Half the staff are warm and friendly and most do not speak any English.  The others do speak English and most of them are haughty, pretentious and supercillious and you would think you were staying with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia in the Palacio Real in Madrid and you are mere street trash they are having over to wash your feet at Easter due to some 1000 year old custom.  YES it was nice when I got  a DEAL DEAL at an online service and never saw that bargain price again.  Even the elevator guard acted like he was some Spanish Grand Duke or General Franco come back to life as a security guard!  EVERYTHING had a price added.  The breakfast if you did not have it included in your deal was an arm and a leg.  Have the nice free coffee in the room and go next door to McDonalds"
40,"We stayed overnight on our way back to the States.  The room was very spacious and quite comfortable.  Although we didn't take advantage of the pool, hot tub or sauna's, several in our party did and they said they were great.  I wouldn't recommend eating at Strikers, but the breakfast buffet was fantastic.  I hope to stay here on my next trip to Guatemala."
40,"Spent a night here at the beginning and end of our Guat trip.  Fabulous breakfast with lots of  fruit, fresh-made omelettes, fresh juice.   Pool is clean and warm. Rooms clean and spacious. Free shuttle to airport. Excellent value."
50,Hotel is in excellent condition and offers a variety of great services at very reasonable prices. Staff is very helpful and attentive. The sports bar is fun and offers great snacks and nice pool tables. The Pool and jacuzzi set up is one of the best I've ever seen. Stay here!
50,"Ok, so my friends said, ""Why are you going to Guatamala? It's a third world country??"" Boy, are they wrong especially if they see the Barceló Guatamala City hotel. I'm not saying its a four seasons resort but it has everything you need from the moment you walk through the sliding doors. I stayed here for the start of a Gate 1 tour in Guatamala (which, by the way is my preferred touring company) and the reception was pleasant from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. They are professional, speak English, smile, and will do anything you need. They even tried to call home for me with success. As I am trying to keep fit (dare I say ""lose weight"") I worked out in their gym which is small but has just enough equipment to give you a workout. There are towels, a water fountain"
40,"The hotel is a reference point if you are coming from the airport of this very busy City. This hotel is huge and provides many services and facilities for its guests: 3 restaurants, currency exchange, spa, gym, jacuzzi, swimming pool and shops. The rooms are spacious and confortable. The sleep quality is very good.  Our only remark is that that the style of the hotel is old fashioned. There is too much moquette in the rooms and in the corridors. We had a very good dinner in the Japanese restaurant. Above all, the breakfast was one the richest we ever tried. Recommended!"
50,We stopped over for 2 nights at this Barcelo Premium Hotel on our way to a tour of Guatemala. It is a very large hotel with very clean and spacious rooms with private balconies. The staff is very attentive and will serve your every need. The hotel has a bar with a lounge singer on the week end. The sport bar next “Strikers” is a lively place to gather at night or for happy hour. We watched the soccer cup games and felt right a home. A large heated pool is located on the ground floor and is secluded from the hotel area.   The restaurant is large and the service is quick. Food is carefully prepared and you will be able to enjoy the local cuisine as well as your own favorites. There are several luxury boutiques within the hotel with local wares and fancies from Mont Blanc to Rolex.
50,"Loved the Barcelo hotel. Great rates more updated than our usual stomping grounds, the Camino Real. The rooms are clean, pool is large and great massages at the spa. We had a great stay. My only two suggestions would be free wifi and valet service. Otherwise a great reprieve in this bustling city. "
40,"Stayed one night in this hotel in Guatemala City on my way back from lake Atitlan .  This hotel is very close to the airport ( less than 10 mins) . I got upgraded to a suite on the top floor. It was a split level room with bedroom on the top level and sitting room at the lower level. But honestly I do not care for the steps going up and down inside the room.   Flat screen TVs and shower and toilets in both levels. Complete amenities like tooth brush, mouth wash , shampoo etc. . There are also bathrobes and slippers in closet. King size bed with numerous pillows and are extremely comfortable. Wifi didn't work properly in the beginning but they sent a technician to fix it right away.   As it was raining all late afternoon, so I did not bother to go out but ordered room service for"
50,"Having spent a couple of weeks living in some fairly basic accommodations it was great to arrive in the luxury of the Barcelo.  Super value for £70 a night and very nicely located for the bars, restaurants and nightlife of zona viva.  Excellent gym and pool facilities plus a few squash courts, which was great.  I got excellent service from concierge and also enjoyed the sports bar and a few games of pool.  massive comfortable hotel.  i would definitely go back.  10mins or less from the airport."
50,"The hotel is beautiful, the swimming pool is yummy, it has a jacuzzi at the swimming pool and also a private one inside at the lady´s locker, it has a gym with Yoga and dance lessons, a steam room. The service was fantastic!! I had the worst nightmare, my purse got lost at the taxi cab arriving from the airport and the service at the hotel helped me to locate it, and 5 minutes later the cab driver returned it to me with nothing missing! thanks to the prompt service at the hotel, specially Rolando the bag guy.  If you ever need a taxi cab at the hotel ask for Jose Esquivel, he took me to Antigua and treated me as if I was in a tourist guide gropu he knows everything and is so very helpful and nice!! I had really an awsome time in Guatemala at the Barcelo. The Hard Rock Cafe is"
40,"We stayed in this hotel before, during and after our tour of Central America.  Great rooms, great breakfasts each morning, gorgeous decor, and loved the shops on site.  Very safe hotel with guards outside always.  Very close to airport! Only bad point is the cost of the Wi-fi!  Good news is that McDonald's next door is free, but not as convenient as using Wi-fi in your own room!"
50,"Dear Sirs,  I am your guest every month (for two nights) without exception. your hotel and your services are excellent. But I have 3 issues in your hotel for which I need you to please pay attention :  1. Last two years I have always come once a month from Los Angeles and arrive in your hotel Thursdays early morning (Delta flight # 457). Although your roll for check-in is standard, but I have no choice to check in early morning. I usually call two days ahead of my arrival and request for early check in but most of the time they don't have room available for early check in. I stay for couple hours until a room is available for me.  2. I reserve my room(s) with breakfast included. Unfortunately they do not allow me to use my free breakfast for the first day, although I tel them"
40,"I stayed at the Barceló for business while I was attending a conference at the nearby Camino Real. The hotel is very clean, very pretty, and very secure. The staff are very professional, courteous, and always greeted me enthusiastically and courteously in person and on the phone. The rooms are perhaps a little bit dated (especially the bathroom), but not in a tired way, and they are pristinely clean. Room service was fast and very well-priced, and the TV had a great selection, and internet was fast (and included in my price!). I didn't make use of the ammenities, but they also seemed quite nice.   My one complaint about the hotel would be location. The area surrounding the hotel is by no means, bad, but is less exciting and has fewer options than the nearby Zona Viva. Granted"
50,"Elegant hotel in the bustling commercial district. It is all that you would expect from a five-star hotel. Upon entering the hotel you see a large vase of beautiful flowers in a very spacious lobby. The check-in staff spoke English and were very courteous and patient. The pool is sparkling clean, as is the jacuzzi. There are locker rooms where you can put on your bathing suit. The exercise room can help you work off the delicious buffet breakfast that you ate at the hotel. The buffet has a lot of familiar things to eat, including sausage, but you can also have some local favorites, such as melon and papaya juice and plantains. If you want fast food, you can go to McDonalds next door or cross the street and go to Pizza Hut or KFC. I'm sure there must be more in the area, but the"
50,"We spend 2 nights and it was worth all the money.. Great rooms we had a junior suite with excellent beds and pillows.. make me realize how bad are mine.. Pool, jacuzzi at 0600 steaming on the guatemalan blue sky a treat.. and walking distance (safe to walk) to Zona Viva where we went to discover the new Hard Rock Cafe.."
50,"I've lived here for two years and delt with many hotels due to my job.  I would recommend this hotel as a best overall hotel.  it is a former Marriott and it shows by the quality of the staff and the beauty of the hotel.  I would definately stay here again.  I got a 2-floor hotel room for my family of 6.  rates can't be beat!  The only problem is that it is on the wrong side of the street for all the restaurants.  However, they have excellent restaurants inside and are close to a McDonalds and Pizza Hut."
40,"Barcelo Guatemala City is certainly ""my home away from home"". Staff is great, location is just perfect, and swimming pool area and fitness center are very good. Rooms are a bit outdated in terms of decoration but very well maintained..... There are 3 restaurants which are all good; and breakfast is fantastic."
50,"Barcelo has a very accommodating staff, very comfortable bed and room, nice shuttle ride to the airport, and good room service. If I needed to stay near the airport (GUA) again, I'd stay here for sure."
40,"Arriving in Guatemala from Dallas, we traveled by bus to hotel Barcelo and were greeted by the staff with snacks and juice before checking in. Our group was large (69 people), tired, hungry, and mostly pleasant but we were very happy to find our comfortable beds!  I was especially pleased to have a wonderful bathtub to soak away my travel aches.  Room was clean, well appointed and comfortable."
50,"Nice hotel, very luxurious, the rooms are a bit small, but who cares?    The pool area, and upper gym, and lower mens private gym are great.  Great service, the front desk was extremely attentive and helpful, the staff really polite.   Slept great, there's some malls nearby, close to the airport.  The breakfast was quite good, also.  Overall, really enjoyed my stay here."
50,"They have everything but only one restaurant at the hotel is good. The Kyoto is overpriced and always empty. I guess it would soon close. This hotel has copied the money manking Marriott program with internet service. They try to charge you $10 (US Dollars) per day for interent service, but next door is a McDonalds that takes up an entire block with even a special coffee section. Best of all instead of allowing the hotel to extract $10 for internet service, it's free at McDonalds."
50,"the hotel is near the airport, like 10 minutes away.they have a shuttle, so you really don't need to take a taxi. Very well kept, all the staff go the extra mile just to please you. The food is also very good, and at lunch time, each day is a different country food; they make the mexican lunch, the spanish lunch, etc... and you have several dishes to decide. they're all very good and tasty. I order a special breakfast to room service, the night before, and they delivered exactly to the minute, spotless order, and even the operator, called me 10 minutes later to check if I was pleased!. the second night, another operator, when she heard it was me, and wanted to ask for my breakfast, she new exactly what I had ordered the night before. amazing!..."
50,"Spent 12 days there and enjoyed everything about my stay.  Staff was very friendly, lobby area was nice, rooms were good, enjoyed the in hotel fitness area and the adjacent fitness club.  I also felt safe there and in the immediate area."
50,I spent a week in Guatemala and stayed in 4 different hotels while there. The highlight was the great wifi connection at Barcelo compared to other hotels. That was not the only great thing. The breakfast was very tasty and mostly authentic. The beds were comfortable and the rooms are large. They sure give you enough toiletries that you should be fine if you forget anything. I only stayed one night so I never used the pool or any other amenities. I would stay at the Barcelo again. The only negatives were the touristy trap prices at the gift shop but it is a gift shop I wouldn't expect anything less...
40,This property is an older one. Good proximity to many areas including the airport. They also have a shuttle to/from airport at no charge. Room was pleasant and ample. Breakfast was good selection. Sports bar has live entertainment. Check-in/check-out not the fastest service.
50,"Such a pleasant surprise. . .luxurious, accommodating, and amenity filled--at Hotwire prices!  This might have been the best $64 hotel room I’ve ever experienced.  A great business-oriented hotel, located in Guatemala City’s best urban neighborhood--but with resort attributes as well.  The front desk agent, Diana, was great to us--even though we had purchased the room through Hotwire.  I requested a room with a view of the volcanoes, and she obliged with a large corner room on the 9th floor. . .with not one but two balconies (one even had patio furniture and a clothes drying rack on it).  Room 932 was light filled and nicely appointed, even if the decor was sort of pre-renovation Marriott.  That said, the bed had great linens, a flat screen tv, and a granite bath--with a nearly"
50,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of a CARAVAN tour and for a city hotel it was very good. The location, room, food, service, decor, and balcony were all fine. The ATM in the lobby was very useful for getting local money. The buffet restaurant was exceptional in the selection of good food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A supermarket to stock up on beer, Coke, wine and snacks was only 2 blocks away and safe in daytime. Hotel security was excellent."
50,"My husband and I stayed here three times as we crisscrossed Guatemala .   Our favorite part of this hotel is its pool and hot tub, the temperature of both are perfect.  As the title says this hotel cost less than high end hotels right across the Main Street but does not lack amenities.   Breakfast is great and the beds and bedding comfortable. V "
50,"I read the rather unfair review on this hotel in Lonely Planet's Guatemala guide so didn't expect much. When we were dropped off after a quick drive from the airport, I was pleased to arrive at a peaceful & cool oasis amidst the chaotic bustle of Guatemala City.  I love bustle - but sometimes you need to get away from it and I can't think of a nicer place.  For those familiar with the Barcelona chain - this one is far grander and more elegant than their UK and European venues, though with a slight hint of 80's Dynasty chic about it.  The front desk staff are friendly, polite and welcoming (we were given a complimentary upgrade to a two storey junior suite) and the breakfast buffet was fantastic.    Those on a business trip may appreciate the Jade Maya branch in the lobby, making"
50,I cannot believe we paid just a $100 for this place.  It is a beautiful five star hotel.  Wonderful wood decor.  We ate in the hotel at the buffet and it was outstanding.  You know if I am lucky enough to go back to Guatemala I will be staying again.
40,"When traveling to Guatemala City., the Barcelo hotel has., great service.,  breakfast served daily. .  The front desk features outstanding.,  service., appearance., and  communication skills., taxi and  shuttle service available,  Security., is helpful., and very professional.  Pool is heated., and VERY enjoyable., pleasant for that long awaited swim., natural hot springs., spa., is outstanding.  The room are sizable., very clean., and extremly quiet.  With hotel located in town., there is outside noise., but there is no sounds that would interrupt your rest.

40,"Front desk service was just OK. Internet is $10/day extra and front desk was not helpful getting password to use it. Rooms are great, Restaurant staff is great. and it is only 5 - 10 minutes from airport. We stayed one night on our own and three nights with a bus tour group."
30,"The hotel was nice, although I've stayed in other Barcelo hotels that offered higher quality of amenities.  The room was small and the bathroom was extremely small.  The shower door opened from the inside and it didn't have a good seal so the water leaked and the floor was soaked after 5 min. You have to turn the shower head to the wall, get in the shower then start the water.. doesn't sound complicated until you are in the position to take a shower.  The food was average, nothing offered of the local cultural.  Internet was not free.  But it was in the city and I did feel safe.  The staff were very professional and appeared to enjoy their job."
40,"We stayed here on two different occasions on a recent trip to Guatemala City.   The first stay  we had a room on the 5th floor.   The room was not near the elevator and was a much nicer room than the room we stayed in  on our last day in Guatemala.  Also, the first room had a little more space in it than the second room.   During the second stay our room was right next to  the elevator which was  bad. We were on a lower floor during the second stay.   It was  a noisy stay and  to top that  the the people in the  room right across the hall from ours   were having a loud party.  Men kept going in and out of the door  and yelling in the hallway and the door was  slamming shut.   I called  the front desk and reported the noise to them.  They  did send a security person up to our"
50,"My last visit to Guatemala was 5 years ago, and back in that time I stayed at the Holiday Inn Guatemala, which was a good choice.  I decided to visit some customers and took a 2 days trip to have some meetings over Guatemala City and wanted to try a different hotel.   I checked options and I finally decided to take Barceló GUatemala, why?. Because 3 main points:  1. Free transfer to/from airport. 2. Rate that includeds premium room and full buffet breakfast. 3. Infraestructure and location  I booked my stay directly through the hotel reservation office doing reference to TA rate ($95.00 USD + tax) that included premium accomodation and free buffet breakfast daily. I got my a friendly replay confirming my booking. I also gave my flight details to make sure I got transportation"
40,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel Barcelo, Guatemala City and enjoyed it very much. The food was really good and the service excellent with a very friendly and attentive staff. We definitely qould stay there again."
40,"Stayed here for three nights. Great property. It's very clean. The staff is extremely helpful and all speak English. You feel very safe. All the entrances are guarded. The pool area is lovely. Our stay included breakfast and let me say the buffet was OUTSTANDING. Great way to start the day. On the down side, the restaurants choices are not great (sports bar, Japanese restaurant, buffet which, while great for breakfast, wasn't as good for dinner) and the decor is a bit dated. However, these issues were more than compensated for by the great staff, comfortable beds and luxury amenities (bath robes, too). The rooms have roomy terraces with a clothes drying rack (always appreciated!). We would definitely stay in this hotel again."
50,"I spent a night here before a flight and was very happy with my stay.  The rooms were large, they were clean, and they had a good offering of toiletries to forgetful travelers.  The elegantly decorated lobby offered several options for dining and drinks as well as friendly, staff.  Room delivered breakfast, which I selected the night before and hung on the door for collection (past the 1AM deadline I might add), showed up when I had requested, it was inexpensive, and most importantly, it was delicious.  The hotel also offers a complimentary shuttle to the airport which was timely and convenient.  My stay was brief and as a result, I didn't get to sample all the hotel had to offer, however I would give this hotel my highest recommendation to travelers looking for a comfortable"
50,"The quality of my stay was superb, with the people in the concierge always ready to help me and suggest me activities in my free time. good restaurant on site very good breakfast good and clean rooms and specially the right price for a very good overall quality"
50,"Have stayed at the Barcelo on 2 recent trips to Guatemala.  Rooms on both occasions were very clean and comfortable.  During our most recent trip, we were upgraded to a 2-level suite which was very nice.  Location is very close to the airport so suited us very well especially since we arrived both times late at night.  The best part of staying at the Barcelo is the wonderful buffet breakfast that is included in the price of the room.  Wide variety of cereals, fruit, and juices as well as an omellete bar.  Part of the Barcelo chain of hotels, this hotel is not a boutique hotel (does not bill itself as such), but is a good, solid business hotel.  Will continue to stay here again on future trips to Guatemala City."
50,"The hotel is extremely clean, staff really polite and helpful and rooms are big and comfortable. But I was most surprised by the quality of the buffets. We had the breakfast buffet, which was excellent, and the dinner buffet, which was outstanding. Definitely a great choice."
20,"My partner and I stayed here for one night and we had a terrible experience at Barcelo. When checking in at reception, we were quoted $120 USD (excl. taxes). One member of staff overheard this and informed us what we could get a lower price of $100 (incl. taxes) if we booked through their booking agency kiosk. She led us over to another desk at the front of the hotel and we subsequently obtained the lower quote. The reason for this discrepancy was not explained to us.  Our biggest complaint about Barcelo is that the service was just atrocious. There is no concept of opening a tab and adding drinks and food to the room as is usual practice in every hotel, particularly one that prides itself on its service. If you want to avoid having to pay by cash or card every time you order"
40,"The hotel is a bright sparkly modern place with all the amenities you would expect. However check in was slow, we had to ask three times to get access to the mini bar, the porter took bags down and left us out of the lift and it let the place down a bit.  For the price I expected it to be perfect and it just slightly let itself down"
50,"Very good hotel, great value, educated people with lot of courtesy in the lobby, in the buffet, the security guys, everybody. We will come back for sure. Good heated pool and jacuzzi, comfortables pillows and bed, the breakfast buffet is amazing with lot of good choices, but people are the best part of the party. Employees deserves congratulations. Wi-Fi works fast and efficiently with no additional fees. Free parking is great. Many thanks for all       "
50,"I spent 3 nights at the Barcelo and had a wonderful experience.  The rooms were spacious and clean, the bed was truly more comfortable than my own bed, the buffet breakfast is excellent  - with a great selection of several different types of foods such that everyone can find something they like, the gift shops had a nice charm and some beautiful Guatemalan treasures (although some were a bit pricey), and the swimming pool and hot tub were perfect.  Check-in and Check-out went smoothly, and they had a free shuttle service to the airport that runs hourly.  It is only about 15 mins. to the airport.  WiFi is free, although I don't know if it's always free - and it is quick and runs smoothly.  I didn't eat lunch or dinner meals at the different restaurants that the hotel has to offer"
50,"Tip: online you can get good deals. Cab drivers in the hotel area always try to overcharge.  Pros: shuttle from/to airport, attentive staff, very clean and spacious room (check my pics), great breakfast buffet (lots of good options) and convenient location (safe area).  Cons: noisy room."
40,"I spent a total of three nights in the Barcelo in Guatemala City which apparently used to be a Marriott property.  Prices are very reasonable.  The room was large and comfortable with all the necessary amenities.  The a/c is a bit noisy but tolerable.   Laundry service is good and prompt.  Reception desk is a bit chaotic and possibly understaffed.  At check-in, they made me wait i for nearly 4 hours until 3:00 PM while they made up the room.  Guests  form lines at the reception desk then other people break in front and the receptionists are too timid to do anything about it.  This can be annoying if you're trying to check out and catch a flight.   Seems to me they could have done a much better job at the reception desk.    The restaurant has a lavish breakfast spread but"
40,"A large hotel comparable to the Grand Tikal Futura. Maybe fifteen minutes from the airport by hotel shuttle. Outdoor pool and the biggest hot tubs - well, one hot tub. Good work-out rooms. Nice views from the balconies. Wi-fi for a fee or with the room sometimes. Helpful staff. Just a couple of blocks from the Metro which will take you to the sights in the city center. Short walk to excellent restaurants in Zona Viva."
50,"Although we only stayed one night on this trip, the Barcelo was a great option and a good value.  The room rate included a fabulous buffet breakfast with options for indoor or patio seating—it’s definitely worth including breakfast.  The free airport shuttle (leaves every hour) was an easy way to get to the airport (about 10-15 minutes away) and there is an ATM in the hotel lobby.  The front desk staff was friendly, helpful and spoke English (for those of us who haven’t mastered much Spanish). The room was quiet, nicely appointed and comfortable and although I didn’t try them, there were a variety of restaurants/bars and some nice shops within the hotel.  The location is very convenient for walking to the nearby Zona 10 restaurants, malls or to access the Transmetro bus.  It was"
40,"A well run city hotel that has spacious comfortable rooms and a well equiped bathroom. It was the only hotel that had complimentary coffee in the room during our 'tour trip' of Guatemala. There was some aircraft noise, but it is not a busy airport. The pool is very nice and gets the afternoon sun and there is also a bar serving light meals there. The buffet breakfast was well presented and with a good choice although it does get a bit crowed at peak times. There are several restaurants with the main one serving a buffet as well as a la carte menu. If you eat in the Lobby Bar you have the choice of the menus from all the three restaurants.There is a small 24 hour supermarket near the hotel (left outside the hotel, about 200 meters and around the corner passed the petrol station)."
50,Stayed at the Barcelo twice in the past week and both nights were great. The second was actually terrific because we were upgraded to a 2-floor suite.  The rooms were spotless. The beds comfortable.  The service in the hotel was excellent. Only complaint might be that the front desk will happily exchange dollars for Q's (at an unfavorable exchange rate) but will not exchange Q's for dollars.  The breakfast buffet was very nice as well.
50,A great hotel with all the facilities in a good location in Guatemala city.  It is very good that you can book a room with the option of breakfast because we had a flight very early in the morning so we couldn't eat breakfast so we didn't pay for it in advance.  The shuttle to the airport is very nice and free of charge
40,"My husband and I recently took a trip to Guatemala City with 2 friends and stayed at the Barcelo hotel for 3 nights. It is a very well-run hotel with great staff who are very helpful with anything you need. One of my favorite people was Fred, the staff at the business office who made all of our reservations/recommendations for restaurants in Guatemala City. The pool/hot tub area is great, and the bar has great drinks.   My only complain was that the rooms were a little dated and the beds were not as soft as I liked. Nevertheless, the hotel is n a great location and all the best restaurants are no more than a 5-10 minute cab ride. The breakfast there is awesome with both traditional Guatemalan and American food.  "
50,"I arrived at the Guatemala City airport in the early afternoon and was whisked from the curb to the hotel by Barcelo shuttle within a few minutes of boarding (free service). Check-in was quick and efficient and staff was friendly and welcoming. The lobby area was spacious and beautiful, with multiple choices for lounging, and filled with flowers and art work. The room was squeaky clean and beautifully appointed, with a lovely view of the city and volcanoes. I wandered the hotel, exploring the various shops and restaurant options, then decided to order room service for dinner. My simple meal of black bean sopa was elegantly presented and delicious. I slept like a newborn babe. The next morning, my pre-arranged ride to San Marcos La Laguna did not arrive (my brother had set this"
40,hotel is nice..good bed too..lots of food places to eat around the the hotel..this hotel is not far from the airport at all..the wifi is great in this hotel.... works all thru the hotel..i travel alot..this is not a 5star hotel..but its worth it
50,Big hotels tend to be cold and distant.  This hotel was warm and friendly.  Only 10 minutes from the airport.  They QUICKLY met every special request we made.  I think you will enjoy your stay here.  There is a KFC and McDonalds nearby if you want some fast food.  A supermarket is less than two blocks away.
20,"We stayed here for 3 nights in March 2013.  I would recommend you avoid this hotel, as there are better options around.  Specially avoid the Barcelo if you travel with a companion and you would like privacy when using the toilet or shower: the geniuses who designed their rooms decided it was cool to save some bucks by not installing locks in the bathroom doors. You read well: you CAN'T lock the bathroom door: it's a simple slide-in door that can be opened from outside at any time - when YOU are inside.  So be prepared for a risky toilet visit.  There are much better options in Guatemala City at the same price range. For instance you will probably get better customer service and a friendlier welcome at the Crowne Plaza Las Americas or Radisson Villa Magna.  They are smaller"
40,"For New Years 2013 trip, my friends and I got this hotel through expedia with a air/hotel package. The hotel is a typical business hotel and it was enough for what we needed it for.   It is about 10 minutes from the airport. Though the hotel offered free shuttle service back and forth to the airport, even at 5am for our Tikal day trip. Via taxi, if you choose not to wait, is about $5 fare. It is within walking distance to Zona Viva yet we were surprised how little evidence there was of a nightlife. We kept hearing from the locals that it's happening in Antigua and indeed it was when we got there to ring in the new year. There is a supermaket two blocks away which was convenient to pick up food and beverage for the trip.  Room was clean and beds were comfortable. The hotel is"
30,Paid 300 usd for a room in this hotel which has not been changed since years or decades. Everything in the room floor looks old and a bit dirty.  Lobby and other facilities look nice though.  Breakfast is nice and sports bar is very nice.  Taxi to go to zone 10 for dinner is 50 Q so you have to pay 100 if you plan to go for dinner as in the area you only have mcdo and Pizza Hut.
50,If you are a little nervous about going to a country you have not travelled in before this is the hotel for you.  You will feel well looked after and very safe.  The standard of accommodation is high and the staff could not be more helpful.  Even if you are nto new to Guatemala you should try this hotel.  It will bring your stay in Guatemala to a new level.
40,"We had a 12 hour overnight at the hotel so we were not able to take in all that  it had to offer. The room looked like it had recently been renovated. The mattress padding and bedding were very comfortable, everything was very clean, the room was very quiet  and requests to the front desk were handled swiftly. All this was  at a very reasonable room rate. On the negative side we were not given a room with a terrace even though our reservation stipulated one. The free airport shuttle only runs on the hour. I believe other hotels nearby have half hourly shuttles. Finally the extensive breakfast buffet opens at 5 AM. However they will not pack you a box breakfast unless you need it before 5 AM and they will not let you grab some rolls and go after 5 AM. Since we had to be on the 6"
40,"The Barcelo Guatemala City hotel has a privileged setting in the heart of Guatemala City. Its elegant 395 rooms offer high speed internet connection for a charge and numerous facilities to make your stay enjoyable. Enjoy Barcelo's business center, shops, sports center, sauna, jacuzzi, large outdoor swimming pool, beauty shop and other facilities. We spent 4 nights at this hotel as part of our Caravan tour. All of our meals were included. I luved the place but what I didn't luv was the $10.00 per day charge for WIFI in the room. The rooms were very comfortable.

So if they want 5 stars from me they better get with"
40,"The rooms are really quite nice - among the best you'll find in Guatemala.  The breakfast buffet is really very good.  Some desk staff are among the best.  Others, well, not so great, which is why I gave it a lower rating.  We were booked here as part of a trip we made to Guatemala through Gate 1 during the time when the Mayan Calendar was ending in December 2012.  We stayed one night on three different occasions throughout the trip.  You'll enjoy staying here for the most part."
50,"I cannot think of what would have made this hotel better. The rooms were huge and clean and mine had a view of the city. The location is quite literally 5 minutes from the airport which is a definite plus in addition to which it is walking distance to various restaurants- Mc Donalds, KFC, Pizza Hut, Hooters and many many more.   The staff- I celebrated my birthday there and was treated to birthday cake at breakfast accompanied by the restaurant staff singing Happy Birthday! And that night a live band played in the Strikers Sports Bar (located in the hotel, opens till late ) and sang for me!! Not to mention, more cake and ice cream!  The food- Breakfast buffet was a massive spread of breads, cereal, hot foods, amazing coffee. And you have the choice of eating inside the"
40,"Great choice near Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport.   Free shuttle is easy to find outside the airport and operates frequently (at least every hour).  Nice hotel with excellent security.  Very helpful staff, most if not all speak English.  Special mention to Fernanda at the front desk and Fred in the Business Center.  Varied restaurant and bar selections.  My rate included the breakfast buffet, which was excellent - huge selection and variety including a omelette station.  Huge room - mine was on the 9th floor, ""older tower"", corner room, overlooking the airport and volcano.  Stunning view and two balconies!  Highly recommend.  Don't worry about airport noise.  There are few planes and with the windows closed you barely hear them."
40,"The tour we took chose this hotel for our stay at the beginning and at the end.  I can't comment on the price since it was included in our tour fee.  It's a very decent  hotel, with a spacious common area.  The room was a typically nice room in a typically nice hotel.  The breakfast and evening buffets included many very good dishes; the pool water was warm; there's a nice gift shop for those who didn't buy quite enough on their stay in Guatemala.  If I were to go back to Guatemala City on my own, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here."
50,"This is a very large hotel, with lots of shops, restaurants, and cozy places to sit and rest.  The restaurants are very good, however expensive by Guatemala standards. The breakfast buffet goes on for yards, literally more than 100 feet long.  If you count your breakfast experience by the foot, then you will be in heaven.  The beds are the most comfortable of any hotel I have experienced in Guatemala, hands down.  The location is good and convenient.  They charge an extra $5 per device (not per room) for internet.  That can add up if you have a couple of laptops.  I will be back for another visit."
50,On arrival from the airport I was pleased to know the hotel was so close to the airport as I was exhausted after travelling from Australia. The check-in service was quick and friendly and the room was fantastic. The next morning I had a fantastic buffet breakfast overlooking the pool area and wishing I had decided to spend more than one night here. I was even more impressed when my shuttle bus to Xela did not turn up and all the effort the staff went to help. I would definitely recommend anyone to satay here and I will also stay here again.
40,"The Barcelo Hotel was located within 10 -15 minutes from the hotel.  My husband and I stayed there two nights at the beginning and one night at end of our tour of Guatemala in Jan.  The first two nights our room had a bad aroma, but when we returned at the end of the tour, we had a better room. The rooms had been updated, but it still had an old feeling to it.  The stores within the hotel had a nice collection of Guatemalan products, and the personnel were helpful.  The lobby and other facilities within the hotel are beautiful with outstanding architecture features. There are three restaurants in the hotel, but we ate the buffet meals at the La Vista all of the time.  At breakfast individual fresh omelets and eggs can be prepared, and at lunch and dinner fresh individual stir"
40,"A friend who frequently travels to Guatemala City recommended the Barcelo, and I have to say it is a good hotel at a fair rate.  The hotel isn't brand spanking new, but it is clean and the room was quite nice.  My biggest gripe with this hotel is that internet access was not included with the room, and it was expensive.  I opted instead to use the internet in the business center, which just wasn't as convenient as having it available in the room.  Others hotels I stayed in on this trip always had free wi-fi included.  There were also a couple of mistakes made with our reservation and with housekeeping, but nothing major.  As the Barcelo is somewhat cheaper than most of its competition in this part of town, it is a good bet."
50,"I've been to lots of cities in central America.  This has been one of the nicest hotels.  The staff is friendly, everything was spotless, the views are great and the wifi is strong (enough for emailing etc).  I would advise you negotiate the rate though.  We were able to get $70 USD per night including a full breakfast.  The food prices are too high in my opinion.  The dinner buffet was $22 USD which wasn't worth it in my opinion.  The beds were a bit hard, which seems to be a common trend in central America, but enough rum solves that problem!"
40,"We stayed two nights in early January at the Barcelo (at the beginning and end of our trip).  Since all the premium rooms were closed for renovation, we stayed in standard non-smoking rooms.  Our first room faced the volcano and our second room faced the pool.  Both had little balconies with sliding glass doors.  The first room was definitely more worn and dingy than the second, perhaps because more people ask for the volcano view and those rooms are used more often?  The beds in both rooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms were modern.  The hot water in our first room was very hot and we had to be careful with our kids using it on their own.  The common areas of the hotel smelled very strongly of air freshener on our first night, but that was much better when we returned."
30,"We stayed at the Barcelo at the start and end of our tour of Guatemala.  Rooms were comfortable and clean.   Most staff friendly and helpful.  Food was so so,    Final dinner actually quite poor, fish severely over cooked.   No free internet was a bone of contention considering we had free wifi everywhere else we went in Guatemala.   Staff say they get many complaints a day,  but management intransigent to changing times."
50,"Barcelo is all that I would expect at a business-class hotel, courteous and efficient staff and modern, comfortable facilities in a safe area.  I was on a tour and ate at 4 hotels in Guatemala and Barcelo had by far the best variety of food at their buffet—especially liked the egg white omlettes made to order.  The pool area is very pleasant and was not at all crowded, whirlpool and pool had good temperatures.  One evening there was a very good jazz trio playing in the lounge area.  The airport shuttle leaves the hotel promptly at the designated time.  The hotel was very lively with various events taking place such as a wedding and a graduation party."
40,"I stayed here on three separate occasions in October and November 2012 for a bit of luxury after a long international flight from Europe, a serious hike-a-thon in the Western Guatemalan Highlands and a sweat-dripping trip to the awesome Tikal!   What impressed me was:  - great sized beds/rooms for crashing out in and sorting out your smelly hiking gear - a decent ( and decent-sized) swimming pool with whirlpool for exercise and chillaxing - top staff ready to help and even have a bit of banter with - excellent breakfast where the guacamole rocked my little world to bits - safety, I never had to look over my back once - proximity to the airport. The transfer was easy-peasy!  This really was an OASIS for me and I wouldn't hesitate to book in again if I am ever in this part of the"
50,"Just another superior class hotel, the service from its staff though makes it unique. Good and safe location and if you take tours of the city no need to worry about the City's safety. The front desk staff members will do anything to assist you. Service worth its price!!!"
10,"I got food poisoing there. Stay was only mediocre until then, room was clean but dingy. Felt very safe though, which I undertand is a priority in G.C. I stayed there though Gate 1 tours which luckily refunded some of my money."
50,"October 2012,  This was my second time to this hotel, both times after exhausting medical missions in small rural villages in the mountains of Guatemala.  The first visit 2 years ago was very unexpected - our plane had mechanical problems, so the airline put us up at this hotel.  After spending almost 2 weeks in very rough accommodations, and sharing rooms with 3 to 5 people per room - the Barcelo was HEAVEN!!  We arrived at 8am and found out that we EACH had our OWN rooms for the next 24 hours!!!    The rooms and hotel are GORGEOUS (and not just 3rd world gorgeous - gorgeous on any continent!).  This second trip was an overnight stay before catching our flight home, and was something I was really looking forward to!  Rates were very reasonable, the food at this hotel was"
50,"I stayed at the Hotel Barcelo in Guatemala City the week before Christmas in 2012.  My tour was organized by Gate 1 Tours, who used a local agency, Clark Tours.  The hotel is only 10-15 minutes from the airport and in a quiet neighborhood.  I was not expecting a 4 star quality because of the price of the tour, and was pleasantly surprised when I checked in.  I was given a large corner room with double balconies and huge sliding glass doors on the 8th floor, with views of the volcanoes and a king size bed.  A big buffet breakfast was included as well.  The staff speaks English and was very helpful.  My only complaint is that there was no free WiFi, as this is now standard at many hotels.  The hotel was probably fairly quiet because of the time of year I was there, but it far"
20,"I had a reservation at Barcelo for nine days. The staff gave me a plain room, instead of the room I had reserved. Their explanation was that those rooms were not available because they were remodeling them. I asked for the manager and was told he was on vacation. A rude supervisor sent me to the business center to ""get help."" Two days later I was on the street with my luggage and no room."
40,"Rooms are a little dated but staff is kind and responsive, the pool area is really impressive and the breakfast buffet is surprisingly good with LOADS of options. Someone from the hotel was waiting for us at the airport and transportation to the hotel went smoothly. Recommended!"
30,"There were some things that drove me nuts about this hotel, and others that were great. Not good: 3 rooms in a row had problems with the lock on the sliding glass door onto the patio. The bath/shower is configured such that you have to be IN the bath to turn on the water, but the hot water is scalding hot, so I seriously scalded my feet trying to turn on the water for a bath.  The good: beautiful lobby with lovely holiday decorations, fabulous full breakfast buffet with lots of tropical fruits. Also I left something in my room when I checked out, and they found it and got it to a friend who was still there. It is close to the airport so that is a plus too. However I had concerns about security with the unlocked door, and I was limping from scalded feet. They could easily turn"
10,This hotel has gone severely down hill since it was the Marriott.  I walked off the elevator and it was so overly perfumed that I choked.  It was just as bad in my room and they now have bedbugs.  Got bitten during the night and had to change rooms.  Disgusting!  Do not stay here!!
40,"Second time in this hotel, the only complaint I have is about the internet service, sometimes goes slow or poor signal. Hotel is located in zone 9 and near to the most of places to go in the city. The bathroom still has some old style bathtube and the height of the shower is quite low."
50,"Our medical team of volunteers stayed at this location and we were very pleased with all the amenities provided.  The hotel is walking distance to a pharmacy, several gift shops, restaurants and even McDonalds.   The complimentary Wi-Fi and breakfast buffet was a plus and because we had over 25 in our party, the hotel gave us an incredible rate.  The staff is friendly and accommodating and took care of all needs.  We will definitely stay at this location for our next visit to Guatemala."
30,"First u need to pay $10 american dollars for internet for 24 hours use (no free wifi), there is a charge for business center, the restaurants are expensive $18 dollars for a buffet, $10 dollars a coktail, and the restaurant services is not good at all and the food is little old and not tasty, next time i will try another hotel in the city."
50,"Transportation to the airport is complimentary with the reservation and it’s only about 5 minutes ride to it. The staff is very professional, friendly and willing to accommodate you.  Fred was on duty when we checked-in and requested a room with the view of the volcano and he went out of his way to comply.  This was great because atop our balcony, we enjoyed looking over all the city lights while having a drink and feeling the cool breeze while watching the volcano‘s activity early in the morning.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and modern in décor.  The complimentary breakfast is exquisite, providing an extensive variety of local Guatemalan dishes as well as all the classic breakfast trimmings.  I was complementing the chef on this meal and he said, wait until you taste the"
30,"The hotel appeared to be very nice, but the room and hallway smelled strongly of cherry air freshener.  We had a room with two beds,  One bed had nice quality sheets,  My bed had poor quality sheets that were extremely scratchy because they were covered in pills (sp?).  and there was a long hair in the sheets welcoming me when I pulled back the covers.  I will go back go the Westin when I return to Guatemala City."
40,"This hotel is great for business travelers. Located very convenient to the airport, the Barcelo Guatemala City has excellent rooms, restaurants and service. I do not agree with the additional charge for Wifi and hope they change that soon."
50,"I will recomend this hotel to anyone traveling to Guatemala.  From the pick up at the airport to the trip back.  The every day comfort, the security, the breakfast, the room itself is the best . It was my second trip to Guatemala.  It is very near to the airpot, but centrical and very safe. The people of the hotel, even the guess they have are very friendly and polite."
40,"The proximity to the airport, service, amenities, and accommodations were excellent.  We really enjoyed the little balcony breakfast nook attached to our room, but we left the window open and were awakened several times to the sound of airplanes lifting off and landing through the night.  Stay here, by all means, but make sure you get a room facing away from the airport."
50,"Location: nice location in the zone 9, just a block away from zone 10 (zona viva), walking distance (2 blocks) from restaurants and plaza ""Los Próceres"" (small mall) and one block from a supermarket. 10 min taxi drive from Zone 14, Zoo, Childrens City, and Airport, 15 min from Zone 1 (downtown). Personnel: pretty nice and warming welcome Rooms: Just what you need, not big sized, similar to american chains like hilton, or holiday inn, and well prepared with everything you need. The BEST: THE POOL!, opens at 5:00 and closes around 23:00, the water is warm, but really warm, it was cold outside and for me it was no possible to think to get into the water after 17:00 with the wind and cold but since my 4 yr daughter was insisting we went and I was amazed that the pool is really warm"
50,"The hotel is huge, the rooms are very comfortable and with a lot of space. What I liked the most is that you can find Oakland Mall near, it's close to the Zona Viva, also the airport is almost 5 minutes away... For me is the best option to stay in Guatemala City. "
50,"This is a nice hotel and very well priced for what it offers.  The airport pick-up went well.  The rooms are very nice - my only criticism is the location of the room safe at floor level.  The hotel location is good.  The buffets have lots of choices.  There was a little problem on check-out.  A lot of us had to catch the 5 AM bus for various flights and there was only 1 person to check about 30 people out.  But, that is an easy fix.   I stay in Guatemala City every two years and will use this hotel again."
40,"The Barcelo is a nice hotel.  I would compare it to a state-side Crowne Plaza.  ""Luxury,"" in this case, is subjective.  That description of the Barcelo might apply for this part of the world, but might be a slight stretch for people from other places.  The lobby is definately luxurious and the hotel first-impression is very good.  My room was average (not bad, but not amazing) by U.S. standards.  The security is excellent.  The hotel is gated, and all comings and goings are monitered by guards.     Without exception, every hotel employee smiled warmly and was both friendly and helpful.  I think of Guatemala as a country of exceptionally warm and gracious people and found that acurately reflected in the employees of the Barcelo.  It has been almost ten years since I last visited"
40,"The Barcelo (formerly Marriot) is a great 'in Guatemala for work business.  I stayed over many time. And is  a great place for the money.  Walking distance from the Zona Viva, so gives you a good opportunity to explore the night life. There are a bunch of souvenier stores just around the corner. Lobby is luxurious, rooms are standard, spacious, clean. Really good bed, minor drawback, the bathrooms needs renovation. Still decent for a Barcelo, but really soon they need to update all bathrooms in the rooms. Pool is awesome, great pool area. If you  have time to relax use the pool area.  Also the spa is great. Get a  great massage. Great value The internet is reasonably fast, the courtesy items in the bathrooms include razors, toothpaste, etc., and it's in a good location for"
50,"We only stayed there the night we arrived in Guatemala and our final night due to its proximity to the airport. It was great. The staff was helpful and upbeat. The rooms were very nice. The pool and spa area was fantastic. The restaurants were a bit pricey, but you could find your way around that if need be. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs to stay in Guatemala City, however I should mention that this is the only place I have stayed in Guatemala City."
40,"Value for the money is very good at this hotel. The included breakfast is excellent, a huge buffet with every type of Guatemalan breakfast dish imaginable. Room is the same as most business class hotels in the US with balcony. It's nice to sit outside above the activity of the city. The hotel is very close to the airport, but the noise from the planes is really not a problem. There is a takeoff or landing about every 15-20 minutes during the day and evening.    The hotel is located in one of the best areas of Guatemala City. However, unlike some of the other hotels there is really nothing within walking distance except McDonalds next door.  This is a repeat stay for me. The Complimentary airport shuttle in a Mercedes Bus is a nice touch."
40,"I stayed in Barcelo for a business 5 day trip. Company arranged the reservation, however the flight was delayed and I tried reaching the front desk but couldn't find a number over the internet that worked. The online reservation website can't access the reservation codes that are not booked online and the email address in the website does not reach either the front desk people. Since I could not contact them to give notice of the last minute change I tried to negotiate early check in the next day and I wanted to stay an extra night, but it wasn't possible. While the front desk person was nice, I felt it was very rigid and because of that attitude I changed my mind and decided to stay somewhere else for the last night. The hotel is well located, clean, room service is ok and the"
50,"First time in Guatemala City, once we arrived to the airport. Barcelo has a free shuttle to the hotel. It's less that 7 minute ride to the hotel, really close to the airport.  Hotel has a great personnel, facilities, and good Buffett breakfasts."
50,"I had spent the previous 2 weeks at Tikal, lake Atilan and surfing at el Paradon, so to finish my trip here was wonderful. the beds were excellent, the pool/hot tub was gorgeous and the included breakfast buffet was the best meal I had in Guatemala. I loved the many amenities, the cleanliness and helpful friendly staff. English was spoken by most, which made it much easier for me. I paid $120 for my brother and I, all taxes and breakfast buffet included, and got this price at the front desk. Some of the web booking places are cheaper, but do not include the breakfast buffet as a result. They were close to the airport, and had a free shuttle as well. It was a perfect end to a great trip."
20,"I have travelled in and around LA for over 25 years on business and always stayed at the Marriott, now Barcelo with a very positive experience in GUA. I have brought my wife and kids on different weekends to visit Antigua and Tikal and we always had this hotel as our base. Upon my late check-in on 7 September 12, I was very unhappy at the lack of appreciation given to a frequent quest. The issue was the ""wireless internet"". On all my previous stays, this was comped, but not this time. I asked them to check my previous many stays, then wanted to talk to a supervisor, then a manager. Still no luck. I guess this hotel will lose my business over a $10/day charge and i will move a few blocks away next time."
50,"I recently stayed in this hotel for a week for a business trip, and it had everything to make my stay very comfortable.  Great central Location Breakfast is delicious and very complete Staff is very friendly and accommodating Gym and Swimming are top quality, and it was very nice to be able to come back to enjoy after a work day.  Souvenir store in the hotel was convenient as I never have time to go shopping."
50,"I booked one night at the Intercontinental based on reviews here. I was dissatisfied - the pool was terrible (extremely hot and low water), the room had broken AC, and slow service.  My flight the next day was cancelled and the airline put my family at the Barcelo. It is the old Marriott. The rooms are same as the intercontinental but the pool area is great as is the restaurant. Their hotel shuttle starts at 4am (intercontinental st 7). A very pleasant surprise."
40,"we stayed here with my entire family.  it was a good chain hotel.  many people liked it for its modern conveniences.  the pool and pool area was very nice.  The food was decent, but very pricey.   we had a total of 10 rooms, and they had us all over the place.  i found it hard to believe they couldn't get them all on the same floor at least.   overall it was decent.  you could probably do better or even worse."
30,"I just wanted to have, a relaxing and good time waiking up at midnight leaking water from the ceiling come on. I'M at the fourth floor! How can it happened.  Don't ask me. So at 1:15 guess what?. We are  moving to  a different room on our way I lost few things. Water came from light socket ball. So still don't have an apology.  From Mr.Villatoro he is to busy to talk to gusted. Not Good.I saw him at the breakfast restaurant but to busy. Hasta la vista Barcelo.. "
40,"Stayed here on a recent business trip. Usually stay at the Camino Real but traveling partner wanted to try this Barcelo (Spanish chain).  Cons were spacious room, nice lobby, excellent buffet breakfast, and nice pool/spa/gym area.  Cons were internet, which I live by. Not only do there charge for it, but they use a convoluted code system which you have to get from the front desk which they spell phonetically in Spanish when they give it to you (C como casa, M como manzana, etc.).  Sometimes the codes work and sometimes they don't. Spent quality time with front desk and finally use 7 different codes for a three day stay.  Big pain in the rear and complained at checkout to a receptionist who had obviously heard this complaint from other guests.  Location is about three blocks out"
20,"The location of this hotel is good.  It is only 10 min to the airport.  However, it needs new plumbing.   The shower in the room that we stayed in kept on changing temperature even without touching the knobs from dangerously very very hot to cold then back to hot.  I complained to the front desk and they seem to know about the issue cause they were not surprised nor concerned.  The Westin is across the street.   Could have stayed there instead."
40,"The Barcelo is a great 'in Guatemala for work' hotel. The internet is reasonably fast, the amenities in the bathrooms include razors, toothpaste, etc., and it's in a good location for exploring the nightlife. The breakfast is of high quality as you have access to the gym and a great pool.  Areas to improve: 1) Nauseating air freshener in the elevators, halls, etc. It may sound minor but it's awful! 2) American style sports bar with mediocre food and no charm. It might as well be in a small town in Texas."
40,"This is a good big city hotel.   The buffet was very varied and fresh.   I'll mention a couple of negatives:   There was a large weeping rust stain on the side of the shower where the metal meets the porcelain.   The piano bar entertainment wasn't available on the two Saturday nights we stayed there.   Unlike hotels in Panama City, you'll have to pay to use the internet or wireless-- this seems a dated charge.  The message light on the telephone flashed the entire time on the second day even though I called twice to have it cancelled.   Other than those issues the hotel has a lovely lobby, the service is pleasant and everything is clean."
30,"Every time. I went out security fallowed me and wife not to see if we were ok .but to check us out, to Mr.villatoro if you already know who is staying.  Why not to give your guess a security and friendly hospitality. I' m coming back in august hope to have a better time than last. Mr cruz from california."
40,"Located near the airport and the Museum of Archaeology in a nice part of the city. The lobby area is elegant with several shops, restaurants and tourist services.  The rooms are adequate but nothing fancy.  Internet connection is an extra $10 for a 24 hour period.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a variety of fruit juices, made to order omelets, good breads, fruit and a variety of traditional foods as well, The outside dining area is delightful.  The pool is large and pleasant.  We walked to a restaurant about 3 blocks away for dinner and felt very safe."
40,"I stayed four nights at the Barcelo Hotel as part of the Caravan Guatemala tour.  The only decent wing of the hotel is the Maya section.  Caravan tours books guests into the older, out dated section of the hotel so beware.  Request a change to the Maya wing.  The room was decent with adequate amenities.  The bathroom was an ample size with a separate door for the toilet.  The air conditioning functioned well and the room was nicely decorated. The breakfast and dinner buffets were excellent.  The variety offered was wonderful.  The salads were safe to eat and the vegetarian choices were varied each day.  The hotel used too much air freshener in the hallways. The spray permeated the room and it was quite bothersome.  The Barcelo needs to invest in natural alternatives to chemical"
50,"Great hotel! It has a great location since everything is nearby! Malls, fast food restaurants, grocery shops, souvenir shops and also la zona viva! The great thing aboutthe hotel is that you have breakfast buffet included in your reservation fee! The food is delicious and the pool is great! Even if the weather is chilly the pool is always warm! What I love the most is seeing airplanes land and depart everyday every hour! Amazing city!"
40,"Crashed at the Barcelo & as any other Barcelo world wide goes, it's a good place and in a good neighborhood. The parking was an issue as I arrived at 2 am.  I had to drive around the block to enter their parking lot (free of cost) as valet was not available at this hour... say what? A Barcelo in Latin America not offering this? Weird! The staff is helpful, the breakfast was superb-better than what the Westin offers.  This is a hotel which I'll always return as it's easy to get in/out of the city and to/from the airport.  Does the price match the quality... it would if I actually used the gym, pool, etc ;-) I usually just arrive to sleep & continue out of the city. Happy travels!"
40,"We stayed at the Barcelo on our last night in Guatemala before flying out the next day.  The hotel is very nice and has a nice pool area adjacent to eating areas and a nice indoor basketball/soccer area besides a workout area with machines and weights.  Most rooms seemed to have a balcony with table and chairs.  We ate at the buffet for dinner and for breakfast and both offered a very nice variety of food items and also a variety of fruit juices.  Although the hotel was very nice, we were still advised to not walk around that part of the city at night and, of course, to not drink water from the tap.  There was only one elevator in service, so the wait was a little long.  We used their complimentary airport shuttle service.  Be sure to inquire the night before.  We planned to"
40,"We stayed over 6 nights at the Barcelo.  The breakfast was included and it was wonderful.  The staff were very helpful and the large heated pool was great.  It is walking distance to the zoo, museums & a mall."
40,"Was here on vacation, and had a great time. Front desk staff were wonderful. The wait staff in the Sports Bar were great as well. The decor seems a little dated. The rooms and common areas could use a little updating. The bathrooms were clean, and they offered a lot of amenities like a show horn, some toiletries, etc. If I come back to Guatemala City, i would stay here again."
20,"For logistical reasons I decided to stay in this property once more. I think this was not a good decision. Once more the airport shuttle was not there when I arrived although I made sure they had ALL my flight details. They confirmed the shuttle was going to be there. However, after 25 minutes wait, nothing. After checking in, I went to my room and decided to make some phone calls, the line was not activated. I called the operator and he explained to me that although I had left a cash deposit for incidentals, it was in US dollars, in order to be able to use the phone I had to leave a cash deposit in local currency. This was ODD for me. So when I went dons stairs again, I checked with the front desk and they said my cash deposit was good enough for phone calls. Contradictory and"
40,"I'll keep it short and brief since there are so many reviews on here, but here is a quick overview:  Stayed here for 1 night on our way up to Antigua. This hotel is very secure, super nice and the pool area is right up there with many resorts.   The beds are a bit firm, but no problem for us tired Americans to get to bed at night!!"
40,"Spent one evening at the Barcelo and enjoyed the stay. The airport is nearby yet quiet, plenty of shopping and eateries. The staff is friendly and helpful."
40,"We arrived from San Salvador by Bus at noon which stopped at some Hotel and walked across   La Reforma Street to Barcelo Hotel around 400 yards away, but the entrance is on a side street. The Hotel is close to many other large Hotels and Restaurants by crossing La Reforma again.and going a block to the left than a block to the right and ""everything"" is in a 3 block area.  Barcelo has a pool like most, the rooms are very large and modern with view if you are further up breakfast was not included but is not cheap, you can buy pastry outside, there is a coffee maker in the room.  The first night we had dinner in this ""typical""  Guatemalan restaurant which is advertised in every Magazin it is a little overpriced but have been there the last 3 times I was in Guatemala.   You should"
50,"Our Medical Team of 17 chose to spend our arrival and departure nights at the Barcelo based upon reviews and positive word of mouth commentary.  We were not disappointed! The close proximity to the airport and courteous bi-lingual employees expedited our check-in process and assured us of our comfort & safety.  The buffet breakfast was amazing...don't miss it, especially the Guatemalan coffee!  Also, the hotel front desk is the BEST place we found to exchang currency!  Their exchange rate for purchasing local Q currency was much better than at the airport! The pool, shops and exercise rooms were very inviting, however due to our limited time restraints, we were unable to take advantage of these ammenities!  We will definitely return to this amazing hotel! We give it a 4* !"
10,"After I left the hotel, paid and signed my voucher I found out 3 days later that the hotel charged my credit card $7.69. I emailed the hotel asking for an explanation of this charge, two weeks later I still waiting for a response from them. It's not the amount of money they have taken from my credit card, it's the way this matter has been done. Also I received via email a coupon from Barceló and the manager didn't honor this coupon. The managers at this hotel hide inside the office they don't have the courtesy to talk to the clients when there is a problem. They always have the front desk people talking to the customers. These front desk people are between the managers and the customer. This is a joke."
40,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The rooms and lobbies were very comfortable. The food at the breakfast buffet was exceptional. Room service was ok but for some unexplained reason I received tomatoes on my ham and pineapple pizza.    The balconies are very nice although the lock was broken. I was on the fifth floor but it was just the principle that the lock was broken. Other than that it felt very safe with adequate security and high gates circling the property.   The hotel is in zone 9, a $4 - 6 minute cab ride to Zone 10 where there are multiple restaurants and bars etc. Zone 10 is great, you feel fairly safe walking around on the cobble stone sidewalks. At first I was envious of my associates staying in Zone 10 where most of the Guatemala City hotels are"
50,"i visited guatemala in april as part of a group. the barcelo is a modern contemporary hotel not far from the airport and a safe area of guatemala city. i have stayed there twice last time at room 910. the room was spacious quiet, nice bathroom, flat tv, and very good modern safe. sleep quality very good. i ate at the restaurant vista few times, its a buffet style with ample selections. had there breakfast too , it was pretty good with a wide selection of guatemalan and western foods.i did not like much the juices since they seemed to be mixed with water not the natural taste you are used to. they have a pool, a piano bar, and tour desk. would i recommend it ? sure and if i go back definetly stay here."
50,"Staying at the Barcelo our first night after landing in Guatemala City was so nice we booked another night for our departure weeks later. The rooms were comfortable, the service excellent, and the pool and jacuzzi were amazing. We would highly recommend staying at this hotel to any traveler. The value of the rooms, and the central location make this a prime hotel that will continue to be one of our favorite in the future. Also, the buffet breakfast was top notch."
40,"We stayed here at the beginning and end of a Caravan tour. The rooms were good and the staff  were helpful and accommodating. It is very close to the airport, but noise was not a problem on the 8th and 9th floors where we stayed. The furnishings in the rooms were a bit shabby, with pillow covers ripped apart in some cases, and though they were supposed to be non-smoking rooms, I'm not sure that rule was always observed. The buffets for breakfast and dinner were good, and quantity generous."
40,"Closest to airport. Shuttle took nevertheless a long time to pick us up. Very helpfull staff everywherer. Gym a bit outdated but good enough. Wifi iffy. Rooms with nice size, quiet and clean. Pool looked good but did not use it. Japanese restaurant in site very good but A/C cranked all the way up. Breakfast very good. Taxis easy to get."
40,We had the pleasure to stay a total of 4 nights at this lovely hotel.  We were traveling with Caravan Tours which includes two nights at the beginning of the tour and one night at the end.  We added a day pre tour.  The hotel is very convenient to the airport as well as the sights of Guatemala City.  This is not a new hotel but it is very well maintained.  The beds are very comfortable.  I will also add that so are the pillows.  The rooms are very well equiped with the things that you need.  The hair dryer probably wouldn't be very good if you have long/thick hair.  Maid service is great.  I especially liked the old world elegance of the hotel.  The dial phones in the lobby!  Built in ice machine near the elevators.    We  ate at the buffet several times.  The food was
40,"We stayed two nights at the Barcelo.  Frankly, it looked a bit run down to me -- the carpets looked dirty, the reception desk had scratches on it, etc.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, but nothing special.  The highlights for my six year old were the elevator, the breakfast buffet and, of course, the beautiful pool!!  On our next trip to Guatemala City,"
50,"The Barcelo has functioned as a final stopping point for our medical mission group every six months for years (including when the hotel was previously owned by Marriott) The hotel rooms are excellent, the lobby is gorgeous, the food and buffets are fantastic, the pool is beautiful, the free shuttles to the airport are very helpful, and the staff is exceptionally gracious and helpful. There are airline companies on site to assist with travel needs as well as two travel agencies who will assist with in country tour arrangements. Its location in the city is safe comparatively for Guatemala City and is very convenient."
40,"Safe and comfortable in the more secure portion of Guatemala City, and with relatively inexpensive taxis at hand rather than having to try the trams. It's oriented toward businessmen and is heavily attended by both Guatemala and US businessmen and businesswomen. A very good buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch (the former built in the hotel's cost) and a relaxed sports bar and grill, plus two good dinner restaurants. Shuttle for the airport was very slow, but free. Service was good although some learning under way. Check-in and helpful desk was good but varied sharply among staff. WiFi costly at $10 for 24 hours but they forgot to turn if off even when we returned several days later during March 2012."
40,Excellent hotel and in a safe area near restaurants and commercial area. Guatemala city can be a bit unsafe but this area was very good.  Business type of hotel but very good value. Travelled during January 2011 but trip advisor doesn't go that far in time.
50,"When using Guatemale city as your transit station for the trip into Guatemala this is a perfect choice . Clean ,good beds, great service and a shuttle service to and from airport which is only 2,5 km away. The staff and especially ms. Priscilla gave us a wonderful service in contacting our shuttle to Atitlan and she she more than happy to do it. Breakfast is very good. Don't hesitate choose this hotel . You will like it"
10,"Please read this to see how the hotel deals with problems. Unfortunately we did have a huge problem and I feel that the way the general manager Mr. Angel Rodriguez ultimately handled the situation was extremely uncaring and unprofessional. My wife and I stayed at Barcelo in Guatemala City on March 22, 2012. One night at this hotel as the start of an anniversary trip. Due to a defective sensor in the elevator door my wife spent the rest of our one week trip wearing a neck brace. In the morning before checkout, on our way to breakfast she was struck by the elevator door and suffered a severe whiplash. I advised the assistant manager on duty and they called an ambulance and took her to a local hospital.  They x-rayed and determined no fractures, but that she did have serious muscle"
50,"Perfect central location close to airport, museums, zoo, shopping, etc.  Food in La Vista buffet was wonderful.  Really nice rooms either in the older section with small balcony, or more delux in the newer tower.  Beautiful thing in the gift shop but more expensive than you will find in the crafts markets.  We stayed two nights at the beginning and one night at the end of a 10 days tour of Guatemala with Caravan Tours.  Everything was spot on."
40,"Close to airport, free shuttle, clean and cozy room, nice view and a balcony, good food, great variety at the buffet, swimming pool and hottub were warm and relaxing, excellent massage, there is shopping and a grocers around the corner from the hotel and I strongly recommend you make personal purchases for gifts and liquor there and not at the hotel, busy and crowded city but there is good security here... we thoroughly enjoyed this classy hotel."
40,"I've stayed at Barcelo Guatemala city on numerous occasions during business trips to Guatemala. You have to know that this is Guatemala. The rooms are dated. They look like my grandmothers living room. BUT the bed is extremely comfortable. And they've updated the TVs to flat panels in the main tower. Minibar selection is a bit underwhelming, but the bar in the lobby is great as well as the sports bar for a quick beverage. The hotel food and drink is definitely overpriced. If you get out and around you will quickly realize that. I give this hotel such a good rating because of the staff...The people really are the heart of Guatemala. They all speak English and are very helpful in assisting their customers.  This hotel is very close to the airport...like car alarms being set off by"
50,"The Barcelo is a traveler's oasis for both business and holiday.  I so appreciate the security and the caring staff.  If you need something all you have to do is just inquire and they will do everything possible to assist you. The restaurants are very good and the breakfast buffet is a delight and very fun to look forward to.  The business center is very helpful.  There is an American Airlines in the hotel that is an added bonus. I love to come into Guate this way, relax and then begin my time in the country and I also take extra time here before I depart to take a massage and relax in the jacuzzi and pool.  A full salon is a treat for mani's & pedi's too (especially if I run out of time before I leave - I know I can look forward to their services). I look forward to staying"
40,"The Barcelo Hotel is nice. For the money you get a nice room, good food and excellent service. The Hotel is modern and clean. I see it as a good place to stay if you are flying in or out of Guatemala city, but planning on spending your time elsewhere in the country. There are better hotels with more ambience and character that would add to a stay in Guatemala City with an added cost. If you do not mind the entire hotel being full of American tourist and you are just using the place as somewhere to stay before heading out to another location in the country, this is the hotel for you. It is a 5 min shuttle ride to/from the airport. I have stayed at this hotel 6 times in the last 3 years and recommend it..........  Also. If you are wanting to catch a shuttle to the airport; be 15"
50,"I have stayed in this hotel twice in the past three years and would highly recommend it. It is very clean with spacious rooms, bilingual staff, several restaurants, a pool and an amazing breakfast buffet. It is only minutes from the airport and and has 24 hour security."
50,"We changed from the Camino Real a few years ago. What a difference. Competent helpful staff, well furnished room and a superb buffet breakfast. Location is fine."
50,"Excellent business class hotel with all the amenities.  Stayed 3 nights in conjunction with a nice Caravan tour.  It was especially nice to return to at the end of a 10-day trip through the country.  The property is immaculate, well maintained and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  Only less-than-great aspect is dining at the hotel's buffet restaurant, La Vista.  Many local and continental choices, but not one item stood out during our 3 breakfasts and 3 dinners.  This was to be repeated throughout most of the tour.  Convenient location, however it's apparently not a great idea to walk around anywhere in the city, but we did venture out during the day and it's a consistently nice area."
50,This was hotel used by our tour group for 3 of 11 nights on tour of country.  Very comfortable.  Loved robes and balcony. Lovely pool and outdoor eating area by restaurant. Friendly and helpful service. Staff spoke excellent English. Great location for arrival and departure as so close to airport. Able to get boarding passes at airline office at hotel or from business centre. Close to fast food outlets and not far from other restaurants across Avenida Reforma but hotel restaurant is fine. Small pizza was large enough for two. Beer in restaurant is quite expensive but you could pick up your own at a small market or store nearby and enjoy it on your balcony.
30,"Seemed like a generic big-city business hotel to me.  But everything was there that needed to be there, and it all worked, and everything was clean.Was only there one night so maybe not enough time to form a better impression.  Employees were helpful and courteous, all seemed to speak English quite well.  Extremely convenient to GUA airport if you're arriving late in the evening and need a place to crash before you get your trip started."
50,"Stayed here for 3 nights during a 5 day escorted tour that included Guatemala city, Antigua,Chichicastenango, and Lake Atitlán. The hotel sits right smack dab in the middle of a major thorough fare in the city.  The compound is gated and secure.  There are several fast food restaruants within a block and numerous shops with local items.  The sidewalk stands are a great place to pickup soft drinks and local beer at a fraction of the cost at the hotel. There is a great mall about a 15 minute walk or you can take the hotel shuttle which runs in the evening. The breakfast buffet is exceptional with selections to suite every culinary taste, excellent coffee and juices.  You can eat inside or poolside which is georgeous with beautifl greenery and a lovely pool.  The rooms are nicely"
40,"This is a very nice hotel with a beautiful restaurant that overlooks a lovely pool.  The morning breakfast was superb (except the orange juice that was like tang).  There was a really nice gift shop inside the hotel that was really good too - I am sorry I did not buy one of the walking sticks they were selling!  The rooms were very comfie, the bathroom was a little small, but we managed.  Here is a hint for you - NEVER take one of the white cabs that lurk around outside.  They do not use a meter and you can get really ripped off.  Always call for a yellow cab, and if you are not Spanish speaking - have the hotel write the address on a piece of paper for you.  Take a cab to the Artisans Village over near the airport.  It is a little touristy, but very secure and there must be 25"
40,"Value for money, really like the room.  Nice breakfast buffet selection as well.  Not everyone though can speak or understand English so you would have to be patient.  Also, their process for laundry delivery does not make sense!"
50,"this hotel is just superb.  Very high class and felt very safe.  I was nervous going to Guatemala with the current warnings and risk factors.  To use the lift to your room in the evenings you had to swipe your room card.  This just gave an extra feeling of safety.  I then went to Tikal for two nights and they stored my luggage.  I walked into the hotel on my return to hear a pianist playing As Time goes By from Casablance (-:  Great hotel I wish I could have stayed longer.  I did not have time to explore the city and not sure whether I would have felt comfortable doing so.  Clark Tours, whom you can access through the hotel, were great in ensuring I got transfers to and from airports on arrivals and for travel to Tikal."
30,"We were booked on a Caravan tour last Feb/March (which was fabulous, by the way).  As travel from our neck of the woods at that time of the year is often subject to delays due to storms, we chose to arrive a day before the tour began.  To keep things simple, we elected to stay at the same hotel our tour began at  - the Barcelo.  Unfortunately, because we arrived ""pre-tour"", Caravan had no input as to room assignment, and we ended up in one of the noisiest rooms in the hotel.  On a Friday or Saturday night, at anything below the 7th or 8th floor, you do not want to be on the airport side of the hotel.  There is a nightclub down below that keeps things thumping long into the evening.  I don't think its part of the hotel, I think its across the street, but whatever, it is very"
50,"I stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City for 1 night, I flew in for the US. The hotel has a great free transit from the airport directly to the hotel. Check in was great and the room was wonderful. Bedding is wonderful. I slept like on a cloud. Dinner and breakfast were delicious. The hotel is located in the business end of town with excellent service."
40,"We stayed here as as transit point for our trip to Tikal.  Our flight arrived in the late afternoon and we needed a night to stop over before heading to Flores.  Hotel picked us up and dropped us off at the airport for free.  Since we were coming back to GUA they stored baggage for free. Hotel is close to the Heldman Alas Bus Station. (10 min cab ride) and the Airport. You can walk to the Zona Viva with little issue.  I would highly recommend if you are using GUA as a pivot point,"
40,"This is the second time I stay in this property in less than 6 months and the change I notice is significant. They were on time picking me up at the airport, they gave me a room nicer than the one I had booked (at least for 2 o the three nights). The service was much better this time. The only glitch I noticed was that the breakfast is stillo the same over and over again. Perhaps it is time to consider options. But overall I am happy with the hotel."
40,"We slept in this hotel for 1 night only before flying to Tikal after several days spent in Chichicastenango, Lake Atitlan area and Antigua Guatemala. It's a proper chain hotel, with all pluses and minuses that come with this fact. But having wide choice buffet breakfast (and dinner) after several days of mostly egg dishes for breakfast in other hotels was more than welcome change. Yes, this hotel really lacks breathtaking views or almost any sort of local flavor, but it is entirely what a member hotel of international chain IMO should be - roughly the same quality in a different places around the globe. And sadly this applies to incomprehensible charge for wi-fi ($10/day) as well! It's quite typical for almost all big hotel chains I've experienced in recent years. So if you're"
30,"There was too much smoke on our floor, the door crack allowed the smell to penatrate our room non stop. That right there is a killer  Pros:  Corner room with 2 balconies,  nice flatscreen (only 3 English stations),  killer king size bed, bathroom phone, bathrobe, good breakfast buffet Friendly staff  Cons:  Toilet doesn't flush properly, non functioning light switches (fake),  no bathroom fan, $10 for internet/24 hours, shower door allows water to ""flood"" floor if you are not careful"
30,"An average hotel in the city, The only hotel during our 2 week trip in Mexico and Guatemala that charged for internet access and it was very slow. The food was average, again the only hotel that served crystalised orange as fresh orange juice."
10,The management at this establishment need to deicde if it is a hotel or a nightclub.  We decided to stay at the Barcelo in Guatemala City as we had an early flight and wanted to avoid the problems that can come with an early morning shuttle from Antigua.  The music and DJ at a function at the hotel were so loud that the mirror in the bathroom was vibrating on the wall.  Hence it was impossible to sleep.  When we inquired with the front desk about the noise we were told the function would be finishing in 30 minutes.  Rather than going to the trouble of changing rooms we decided we could wait 30 minutes.  90 minutes later it was still going and so we asked to move rooms. (the last thing you want to do a few hours before an early morning flight).  We moved to a room 8 floors up and
50,"Guatemala City has little to offer to tourists. But if you need to stay in the city for transit to another location in Guatemala, or for business, then this is a great place to stay.  Nice and clean, and has all the amenities of a 4-5 star hotel.  One big negative is no free wi-fi.  Rooms are nice and have all the regular amenities.  There is a business center, restaurants, spa, and pool.  There is a free airport shuttle which is nice, but we had a slight issue with it, as they took us to the wrong terminal for our flight. The driver never asked us our airline, and we did not know that the local airline operates out of a different (far away) terminal. So we were in a panic to get the right spot in time for our flight. So if you do use the shuttle, make sure to tell the driver"
40,"We arrived Guatemala city on Dec 30 and were upgraded, our room was absolutely lovely with a nice King Bed and TV. After staying in Belize and Tikal, it was refreshing to be in a modern hotel with all amenities. The hotel is 5 star, and has a shuttle to receive and drop off people to and from the airport. They are also able to arrange a shuttle to Antigua at reasonable rates. Their restaurant has good food, I really liked their food and milk shakes, yummy! Their breakfast was amazing, buffet-type with a large variety of cereals, juices, omlettes, guacamole, salsa, french toast or pancakes, some meat variations, bread, desserts, and coffee. Very tasty and filling. They have a nice souvenir shop as well.  The second night I had a hard time sleeping. I wasn't sure if new mosquitoes"
50,I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while on vacation and it was fabulous. Definitely equivalent to any four-star hotel in the US. Shuttles run from the airport at quick intervals. The amenities in the room are great - I never even unpacked most of my toiletries. Room service is well worth it. One of our travel companions gave a thumbs up to a massage in the spa. Breakfast buffet is huge. There is a sports bar with pretty good food and NBA games on the multiple TVs. There is a small jewelry shop near the buffet that has very good prices. Hotel staff will discourage you from leaving the hotel at night and there are security guards everywhere. You'll feel very safe while in the hotel.
40,Barcelo is a regular commercial city hotel. Presented in such a clinical way that there is no reason to criticise it. A bath that didn’t drain was made good immediately but they failed to plunge the hand basin. All other amenities was as to be expected in a large hotel. The swimming was incredibly warm and welcoming. Breakfast had a wide selection. It is almost unbelievable that a hotel of this size should charge for a wifi facility especially since for those like ourselves who as a matter of principal will not pay $10 for an evenings use have to venture out into unlit streets to a KFC to wish relatives at home Happy Christmas. Reception were cold and disinterested.
50,"I stayed for one night as I had an overnight layover in Guatemala City. The price was decent and the hotel was fabulous. My room was clean, large and beautiful. I was very pleased and would return again for sure. The free Breakfast was amazing and the airport shuttle was on time and drivers were friendly and professional."
50,"Barcelo Hotel is a wonderful value.  It is close to the airport but soundproof enough that you are not troubled by aircraft noise.  Fabulous breakfast buffet, wonderful pool and spa area and good gym.  Easy to walk to good restaurants and shopping and convenient to get downtown to tour historic areas.  Hotel service was excellent.  Room was spacious and comfortable."
50,"We regularly stay at the Barcelo because it is an oasis in one of the nastiest cities in this hemisphere, Guatemala City. It is located in a relatively safe area with good restaurants and shopping, which is a change for us living in rurral Guatemala.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are awesome.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  There is a great pool and the breakfast buffet which is included in the price of the room is the best I've had."
40,"My husband and I stayed at the Barcelo Guatemala City for three nights in early November as part of a Gate 1 tour.  We were met at the airport by a driver from the hotel, which was pleasant.  Our first night we were in a room which overlooked a nightclub, and on a Friday night it was extraordinarily loud.  Fortunately, closing the balcony doors eliminated 90% of the noise.  The beds were comfortable, with lots of pillows, and the bathroom had all of the amenities one expects in a hotel in a city.  Since we had checked in after dark, it was a bit of a surprise to open the drapes in the morning and see volcanoes on the horizon.  As my title says, the breakfast buffet was awesome.  Six kinds of juice, yogurt, cereal, custom-made omelets, tamales, runny Guatemalan oatmeal, sweet"
10,"It is 2:31AM and the party continues somewhere near my room. The hotel reception doesn't answer my calls. The only time the phone was picked-up, whoever answered said the music is usually over by 11:30PM.  But that is just the last of a continuous list of poor service incidents. 1. We arrived to an empty bell station. No help with the bags until we were hauling them on the cart ourselves. 2. Our reservations, made in person last Saturday, were not registered. 3. We were given the wrong minibar key, the wrong internet passcode and the worst location for a good night's sleep. 4. It took 20 minutes to get out of the parking lot and we still don't know why.  There are many more hotels in Guatemala; most that have better service. Don't pay less for less."
50,"We stayed at Barcelo for 3 nights on a tour of Guatemala through Gate 1. It was really nice. The rooms were upscale (though the beds were a bit hard) and had robes and slippers and shoe horns, shaving kits, sewing kits, etc. Both of our rooms had two balconies including a little patio set and great views of the city. They have an hourly shuttle to the airport and taxis always on site to take you somewhere. They had a nice gym and a great pool and huge hot tub. They had several restaurants. We ate at just one, but had a phenomenal breakfast buffet as well as a nice dinner buffet and one night just entrees. The business center was a bit odd- the women there wouldn't let you just use it- they kept wanting to actually lead us to the websites we wanted to go to. Also, we got bad"
50,"Nice modern hotel located near airport. Came as part of my Guatemala tour. Stayed 3 different times at Barcelo on this trip.  One time view terrible (roof and tall building) and 2 times excellent view.  Ask for decent view Included breakfast is excellent Has internet, but $10 Walking distance to nice modern mall with stores and food court Friendly competent staff"
50,"Amazing hotel. The best we've seen in Guatemala. Highly recommended on your trip. They had a good lounge area to sit in as well.  They were very very helpful in everything. Even though we only stayed there for one night, they were willing to keep our bags for 2-3 days while we spent the day in Tikal. We came back and took the free shuttle to the airport. They also promised us lunch boxes since we were leaving earlier than their breakfast, however due to a miscommunication - the boxes were not there.  The rooms themselves are great - very comfortable (the most comfortable bed in Guatemala, really), and good view, and all around quality affair.  Location was great too - right next to Zona Viva.   Room for improvement: 1. Have the shuttle go every half hour during peak hours 2."
40,"We just returned from a quick trip to Guatemala and stayed 3 nights at the Barcelo Guatemala City.  I have no complaints about the service, clean appearance, courtesy of employees and overall experience at the Barcelo.  The buffet breakfast was very good and had a larger selection than many we have experienced.  I would definitely recommend the Barcelo.  We were there as a part of a package tour so I am not aware of the cost of staying as an individual booking separately."
40,"A very nice, comfortable room with an outdoor patio overlooking delightful areas.   Very, very helpful personnel."
50,"Great hotel. Check in was a breeze. They had everything ready before we arrived as we were expected. The front desk staff were amazing.  Anytime you went to the desk for any thing they knew who you were including your name. Rooms were very comfortable and most had balconies. We had 2 rooms at differnt times with 2 balconies each. Great views. King size beds? Just ask. Breakfast was a delight, many choices. Hotel is very close to the airport. The hotel provides a free shuttle to  and from the airport as well as to the main shopping centre. The business center was very well equiped and the staff very helpfull."
50,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. This is an all-around top notch hotel for vacationers and business travellers alike. The lobby is well-kept and gives a nice vibe. The staff are all wonderful. The security seemed good. The rooms were excellent, with all the amenties you could want- instead of just the usual shampoo, conditioner and lotion, they give you a personal bath sponge/pouf, toothbrush and toothpaste, sewing kit, shoe horn, razor and shaving cream, comb, vanity set, shoe buffer and a nice olive oil soap. I didn't like how the shampoo and conditioner were actually in dispensers in the shower. The showerhead was situated so it really was aimed right at your face without so it was hard to shower and not get your hair wet- I heard other members of the group also"
50,Barcelo is a first class stay at all levels. The hotel provides a very nice shuttle van to and from the airport. The rooms are well appointed. The lobby has a number of excellent areas to meet people for business discussions. Breakfast is included in the room rate and is the best buffet service that you will find. I have stayed at this hotel on 5 different occasions and have found it excellent each time.
30,"I stayed in this hotel (previously a Marriott) for the 7th or 8th time this past August (my previous stay had been in 2009). The experience was disappointing. The room was not well maintained, particularly the bathroom, and you knew it had seen better days. The worst part of the experience was checking out. I had to catch an early flight, and so did a lot of other people, but there was only one person at the front desk. There was some sort of problem with a passenger’s bill that resulted in having to wait in line for about 15 min (a lot for someone with a bad back) and missing the shuttle. After some complaining, I was sent to the airport by taxi with another passenger at no extra cost. Breakfast is my favorite part of this hotel; luckily this was still as good as before."
40,"This is a great hotel in Guatemala City.  Nice rooms, beautiful lobby and grounds, great food both at restaurant and at the buffet."
30,"The hotel is one of the biggest in the city but the hotel entrance and the lobby prove that it is not really new. The location though is not so bad. There is a mall called Los Proceres not far from the hotel. They even offer a free shuttle (only from 4pm-8pm) to and from another place called Oakland Mall.        We were given a room in the old building. While it was spacious with a balcony and all, they didn’t pay much attention to cleanliness. The bathroom floor still had strands of hair (obviously not ours). The bedside table was dusty. The amount of cleaning, during a 5 day period, was minimal.   The breakfast is alright with its variety of food. The internet is free for certain packages so it’s best to verify beforehand.  The gym is open 24 hrs so it’s a good thing for"
50,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel and received the best attention from staff all around.  They were friendly, spoke English very well, and would stop whatever they were doing to show or get whatever you needed.  The lockers for the swimming pool are a little hard to find but once you ask they will walk you to them.  The breakfast buffet was top notch.  It is also very close to the airport.  I would definitely stay here again, no hesitation."
50,"This hotel does everything right - service, food, rooms, gym, pool...I couldn't fault it. Guatemala City isn't the greatest spot to spend too much time in, but it is a major business center and has some good museums as well. The incredible old city of Antigua less than an hour away as well.  This is a great hotel choice."
40,"I visited a friend in Guatemala City just for a night and booked at room at the Barcelo based on TripAdvisor reviews.  Although Guatemala City was underwhelming (beyond underwhelming), this hotel was lovely.  The room was spotless, the bathroom was clean and well-equipped.  The breakfast buffet (included in the price) had a terrific spread -- everything you could ask for.  I had some great sushi at the in-hotel restaurant.  I didn't use the swimming pool because the weather wasn't amenable, but it looked lovely and had a large hot tub attached.  I checked around the property.  There was a nice-sized health club, and the staff of the hotel were great.  I was relieved to find that there was a hair salon at the hotel and that it was open on Sunday.  I got a nice haircut, but the"
50,"We flew into Guatemala City in the early am and we were much more exhausted than we realized.  The shuttle was free and easy to find.  The staff at the Barcelo was extremely accomodating and allowed us an early check in.  I was just hoping they would let us store our bags until it was the normal check in time.  I had a child wet the bed and they were very kind and helpful in cleaning up. Everyone we met there was friendly.  My children were adopted from Guatemala and it is evident that the hotel did a major addition to accomodate those families only to see adoptions halted.  The pool is huge and a great temperature.  There is a baby area, hot tub and plenty of lap swimming.  We had it all to ourselves a few times.  The breakfasts were perfect for us because it was buffet style"
40,"It's 10 minutes from the airport(GUA) and you can use the hotel free shuttle, you must pay for internet esperate, breakfast was good, the gym was OK to get by, work out during the day cuz the lighting is dimmed there. Hotel itself is safe but outside is pretty tough, use Taxi and don't walk around at night, I heared thiefs are big on cell fones. the pool and jacuzi are nice surrounded by nice landscapping.  the have a travel industria discnt. for $50 a night."
50,I stayed at this hotel overnight on my way to Antigua. It's located not far from the airport and there is a hotel shuttle service to and from the airport which is very convenient. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the rooms were nice and clean. There are a couple of nice restaurants at the hotel and the dining area (where the breakfast buffet is in the morning) is quite pretty with a nice view of the pool and tropical plants.
40,"We decided to spend one night in Guatemala City to catch an early flight home, and the Barcelo was perfect for that.  It is ten minutes from the airport and they have shuttles every hour on the hour, starting at 4 a.m. The hotel has several restaurants, including a Japanese restaurant.  Breakfast is included and they start serving at 5a.m.  All in all, it is a very convenient hotel. "
50,"Although it is part of a small chain and is very large, the special attention made it feel more like a boutique stay. The breakfast buffet is fabulous and make sure you eat outside on the patio. And the pool area - wow!"
30,"Looks exactly like the photos online, no surprises. Rooms were ok but great for the price we paid, $84 w/breakfast. They have two buildings, we stayed in the older building which was very clean but those rooms must have been smoking rooms at one time, they had a stale smoke smell that they tried to mask w/spray but the odor is in the carpets. I tried several rooms, same results. But you only smell it when you first enter, then it goes away. Friendly, helpful staff especially the Business Center, they were a tremendous help w/a wealth of knowledge. We definitely felt very safe on the property, excellent security. Nice size pool & jacuzzi. The breakfast was well worth including in the price of the room, good variety of food on the buffet & omelets made to order!"
50,"Stayed here July 3 and 4,2011 and loved the hotel. It has large rooms, all with balconies, an imposing lobby with a piano bar and several restaurants and shops. The breakfast buffet has something for all tastes in a quiet setting either overlooking the pool or inside. While right in the center of the city and quite close to the airport,it is very quiet and safe. Personnel are very polite and helpful. There is a wonderful carpet made of sawdust on display in the lobby, that is similar to those they use in the Antigua Holy Week festivities."
50,"We stayed at the Barcelo for three days at the beginning of our trip, and then again for three days at the end of our trip. This is an outstanding hotel with good security, which is important in Guatemala City.   Our room during our first stay overlooked the pool area from the 5th floor (507). The room was beautiful, the internet speed fast ($10/night), the view nice, and the comfort of the overall stay was definitely great. The staff that we interacted with were fabulous, all speaking English very well, and all wanting to make our every wish come true!  Our daughter was attending school with the Guatemalan Exchange student who lived with us 2-years ago, so my wife and I spent lots of time relaxing at the hotel during our first visit. The pool area is VERY well kept, and the"
40,"This was our final stop on a tour of this lovely country. The hotel certainly is lavishly laid out and we felt under dressed arriving in our travelling clothes! However the staff were very pleasant and the room on floor 8 was really quite sumptuous. I wouldn't have wanted to sleep in the next room to the party going on until the late late hours on the floor above somewhere, but perhaps partying in your room is ok in Guatemala City!? Food and service everywhere was good, breakfast especially. There is a sports bar, open to the public, attached to the hotel where service wasn't that strong in comparison to the main area. We were there for one of the Galactacos games in Spain which is treated like a fiesta in the bars in the hotel- they do like their football! I have to say the"
50,Excellent hotel.  I have no complaints.  Very good value and nice rooms.
10,"Overall hotel looks good but they have no policy.  I have one sleeveless t-shirt (not actuaaly, short sleeve), morning I wear it to go breakfast. After breakfast I change my cloths jacket, trouser, necktie etc. and start to meeting in my bussiness trip.  In this hotel, this morning they told me that I have to wear the shirt with sleeve. This is breakfast. If it is dinner, I can understand. The funny thing is breakfast saloon located at the swimming pool. No seperation, no door, totally open. When you have your breakfast, you can see all the peoples with swimwear. Also peoples coming there with short, ladies wearing strapless shirt etc..  I never seen such a stupid things even in Pakistan. What is this? Very conservative country or what?  Most funny thing, today is 3rd day of my"
40,"It's a big hotel with several restaurants, their breakfast buffet is excellent.  It's in a fairly safe part of town, we walk a lot and headed over to the Zoo, it was closed the day we went. But next door is a huge Mercado with everything a tourist would want or not.  Crossing the Reforma is ok, just go with signals.  Restaurants are good in the Zona 9 & 10.    The hotel has a nice swimming pool and we recommend getting a room near the top floors of whatever bldg. you will be in as the view of the city is interesting.  The Airport is near by and you can hear the jets coming and going. Also we tried to exchange money and the directions from the hotel staff to a nearby bank were very difficult to follow.  They wouldn't exchange any money at hotel.  Otherwise it's a clean"
40,"Just returned from a 4 day stay at the Barcelo.  Overall, I was impressed with the property and the staff.  Here is a quick breakdown of the good and the challenges:  Pros:  Walked out of Immigration and their free shuttle was right there waiting for me.  Hopped on and they had a ice chest of cold water.  Very nice.  Check in was a breeze.  The staff spoke excellent English and did not laugh at my attempts with bad college Spanish.  My room was not ready, so I sat in their beautful lobby bar and had a cold beer.  Que bueno.  I should also mention that during my entire stay, the staff was absolutely on top of every request and question.  Their service level was spot on. My room was extremely nice.  I had two seperate balconies and a nice view.  You can tell this used to be a"
40,"We stayed here for three nights during a trip to Guatemala.  pros: - just 10 mins to the airport, free shuttle will pick you up and drop you off - fantastic breakfast buffet - very friendly and accommodating staff; always willing to go above and beyond to help out with stuff (including agreeing to 'vegetarianize' a bunch of dishes on their menu for me) - nice, clean, large rooms - if you are flying American, you can check in at the American counter right at the hotel. You can then get to the airport just an hour in advance - if you are there for business, the hotel has nice gift shops (bit pricey but) where you can pick up some really cool stuff - great pool and jacuzzi  Cons: - this is not in zona viva so if you dont want to eat at the hotel restaurant, it is a 15 minute walk"
40,"The Guatemala city is a good place to spend one’s vacation. The Barcelo hotel offered a great stay. The staff were friendly and hospitable. The food was nice with servings of fresh fruits. The breakfast buffet was the most wonderful. It offers different varieties like eggs, meat, cheese, pastries, fruit juices, every day. The room where we stayed was clean and beautiful. The bathroom was modern and had enough toiletries. The pool is a nice feature there. We had an enjoyable and wonderful time there. I would like to stay at this place again if I visit the city again."
50,"We arrived in Guatemala with family for a 4 days vacation trip. We had a wonderful experience in the city. It was almost the same in Barcelo hotel also. Hotel staff were amazing especially for their excellent sense of hospitality. Always wore a smile that looked quite natural. Breakfast was certainly the highlight, oh it had a large variety to select from. I would like to recommend Barcelo to all my friends and relative."
40,"This is a great hotel at a very good price. The breakfast buffet is really good. They have at least 5 fruit juices (sorry guys...orange juice from the bottle). For a hotel located in a country that export fruit they should offer just-squeezed orange juice!... Also, there are a lady preparing eggs at the moment and have 5 or 6 side dishes, like beans, sausages, quesadillas, french toast, pan cakes, etc. Every day they offered a different assortment so you won't be bored of have breakfast at the hotel. The only small issue is this hotel is not located in the zona Viva (Zona 10) but in the Zona 9. I mean, if you want to enjoy the nightlife you will have to take a cab (I don't recommend to walk during the night) to cross 3 or 4 blocks (Reforma Ave) where all the bars and restaurants"
50,"We just came back from a wonderful 5-day tour to Guatemala organized by Gate 1 Travel.  The 1st and 5th day were travel days so technically, the touring days were days 2, 3 and 4.  We visited Antigua, Chichicastenango and the open markets there, and Lake Atitlan on days 2 and 3.  Had a fabulous time.  Day 4 was an open travel day where some folks on our tour went to Tikal, others did a Guatemala City Tour.  By all accounts, everyone had a very nice time.  Barcelo is a very nice hotel with a wonderful breakfast buffet.  We loved the wide variety of selections and the fresh fruits!  My children also love the pool there.  In Chichicastenango, we stayed at the Mayan Inn, which was incredibly charming with beautful gardens, views, and lovely parrots.    We really enjoyed our stay in"
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Barcelo in Guatemala City for three nights while traveling with Gate 1 Travel.  We found the hotel to be very clean, modern and perfect for what we needed, which was easy access to the airport, easy access to restaurants, and easy access to changing money.  Since we had read that you should avoid using ATM cards (our usual form of obtaining money when we travel), we were pleased that the front desk was able to change money for us quite readily.  We had the breakfast buffet two mornings, where they had a huge variety of items to choose from.  Unlike another TripAdvisor reader, I did not have difficulty getting more coffee during breakfast, although I did have to ask for it.  We ate once in the bar and had drinks and snacks out by the pool.  Everyone"
50,"Clean and inviting hotel, all conveniences!  Morning breakfast buffet was great, and enjoyed the Sports Bar at street level."
50,"We loved this hotel! It was a perfect location, people were very accommodating and friendly, public areas were very nice. Buffet breakfast was excellent with made-to-order eggs, meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, pastries, etc. There was nothing missing at all. When I asked for a quiet, upper floor room, the hotel gave us a top-floor, corner room. It was perfect!  The outdoor pool is huge and hot tub is large as well. We had absolutely no complaints whatsoever about the Barcelo and would definitely stay there again."
40,"The hotel is lovely and views from the 8th floor were great.  The front desk staff and staffs in the restaurants were all friendly and helpful.  The room was large and comfortable and clean.  The beds were very firm, which I prefer.  The breakfast buffet was huge and I really liked all the fresh fruit.  Coffee grows in Guatemala but it was impossible to get a second cup at breakfast--at least there was a coffee maker in the room.  I also appreciated the airline offices right in the hotel--very convenient.  Only downsides:  The first night we were on the third floor and I discovered why the blackout drapes wouldn't close completely--the very corner was tucked into the sliding door so the sliding door would not lock.  It was concealed by the decorator drapes and sheers.  Don't"
30,"I remember this place back when it was the Marriott and it seems to have losts something... maybe it was the busy weekend.  There were youths belonging to soccer teams running and screaming loudly, many parties going on as well.  Bottom line, vey loud and poor quality sleep.  I appreciate the fact they want to keep the rooms clean...but walking on a WET CARPET is not pleasant.  The beds are OK, internet is fast, TV ok, in room safe, minibar.  Bathroom way too small for a hotel of this class, they really just gave it a superficial makeover,bathtub, sink, toilet and such are the same from back in the day....  I find it to be anadequate business jhotel but not a place I would go out of my way to stay at."
40,"Shuttle from airport was good, pool and jacuzzi very good, breakfast great. Convenient to Zona Viva, but could be a bit closer (you have to cross a major boulevard).  If you don't want to go out, there's nightclubs and lots of eateries on site.  One drawback, wi-fi is $10.00 per day.  Balconies in tower facing volcanoes and airport very nice, we were on 9th floor.  There was an odor in the bathroom and tub didn't drain properly, maybe GC plumbing has issues.  All in all, the place was friendly, security was good and staff helpful.  We were on Gate 1 package and it was a great deal."
50,"We stayed at this hotel on the last night of our Guatemala trip, hoping for a relaxing and luxurious way to end the trip, and were not disappointed.  The hotel is well run and the service excellent.  We especially enjoyed using the heated outdoor pool and hot tub in the evening and having the BBQ buffet dinner by the poolside.  The hotel has a number of nice shops and restaurants which all stay open late.  The breakfast was excellent and ample.  The free airport shuttle was right on time the next morning, and only a few minutes' ride to the terminal.  The staff were all very efficient and professional.  The room was a standard business-style hotel room and very comfortable.  Really the only negative is that there was some noise from the street level (even all the way up on the"
50,"The hotel has it's own shuttle from the airport (to the right when you exit the airport after customs: someone is there telling you where to go) Our tour got the info, but can probably e-mqil the hotel the incoming flight info. The hotel is pretty close to the airport (and the zoo) The hotel itself is great, and one of the better ones I understand. They have a greatand extensive  buffet for Breakfast (included) and lunch/dinner ($20)Also A la carte options.  Also Japanese restaurant with great suchi, and a sports bar with burgers etc. The pool is nice with very warm water, and a nice spa. Can get drinks and nacho's at thepool bar. Internet is avaialable in the business center (with free coffe and muffins) for $2/15 minutes. Rooms have balcony and good A.C., iron, hairdryer, and"
50,Rooms are clean and comfortable!  It's very relaxing and nice.  You can walk around the hotel area it seemed safe to me.  there are local handicraft shops out the door to the right and across the street from McDonald's.
40,"I've stayed here several times- all are almost carbon copies.  The location is very close to airport, would like it to be a bit closer to the main restaurants and bars- but its not too bad.  The service seems OK, nothing special- they seem to just do an efficient job, but nothing to suggest the best service ever.  The hotel itself especially on weekends has a very international convention-type feel, lots of weddings, shows etc.  The rooms are very business-like - but nice.  The pool area I think is great - its not used as much as it should.  I love the breakfast, huge spread, very relaxing to sit outside.  Some rates are as cheap as $70-75 per night - with 2 breakfast worth $15 each or so included.  Compared to Westin, Interconti- I think this is the best value overall"
40,"Stayed at the BGC on a group tour and loved it. The lobby is very nice and check in was very easy.  The room was of good quality and very clean. Breakfast was included daily and the buffet was very good including  a good amount of local foods.  Nice lobby bar and about a 10 minute walk to the ""Zona Viva"" area with some really nice restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay there again. "
40,"I ended up upgrading the room to have access to exec floor and internet. I felt pushed to upgrade as everything i asked for cost was 20usd - 20 for breakfast, 20 for internet, etc. I was so tired that i didnt have the strenght to discuss, but i'm not sure it was a good deal. Other than this point in checkin, i had a pleasent stay. The bed was harder than i like and bathroom should be renovated, other than that room was comfortable, clean and spacious. I'd definetely go again, but i'd also like to check westin and intercontinental, their surroundings looked more fun and alive."
30,"I found this to be an average hotel in Guatemala City.  I stayed three nights.  I found transport to the airport, great service, clean rooms, good restaurants and a heated pool.  Unfortunately, I stayed one Saturday night.  The hotel sponsors local parties downstairs.  We stayed on the third floor.  At 11 pm the noise below us was so loud that the floor  vibrated.  We had to call the management and make a move to another room that night."
40,"I stayed one night in GC and selected this airport based on price, location and (most importantly) the free airport shuttle. As a solo female traveler arriving late at night, I felt safe from the airport to the hotel. The service at the front desk was good, the breakfast was available from 5am, and the room was clean. (I agree with comments from other posters about the age of the hotel though - you can tell especially in the bathroom - that the property isn't that new.)  I would certianly stay again and recommend to others."
40,"After arriving at 10pm after 17 hours of flights the barcelo was ideally located close to the airport, complimentary shuttle arrived just a few mins after we exited the airport.   Staff also helpfully suggested using the shuttle the next morning to go back to the airport and get a bus to Antigua from there, for $15 had private mini van to Antigua which only took around 40min, hassle free travel! "
30,"Typical american city hotel, ( rebranded Marriott, I think) from early 80ties, large marble loby, ""golden"" lifts, large breakfast room and lobby bar and some shops. Hidden behind stainless steel security bars and heavy gates gives you a safe feeling in the Guatemala´s capital of crime. Breakfast is OK, corresponding to international standarts,rooms are a bit outdated with all american equipment and strange  paper labels Barcelo on aircon control and Barcelo bathroom amenities which seem to be the only change after rebranding. Rooms are still in  quite good shape after all those years, carpets clean and the bathroom in marble still OK, however the heydays of such design are gone long time ago. Poolside area looks good from the room window, but did not have time to try. Overall"
40,"I had a good Stay at this hotel, They have a great gym absolutely great rooms and great food. However the Payment policy is not right. I was booked at the hotel for US$ 89 Inclusive of taxes. This hotel does not accept dollars to pay the bill in local currency. U eventually pay higher as the hotel uses the exchange rate to their advantage.  My suggestion, be prepared for an additional 5-7% increase after actually paying the bill. In spite of this, i will come again to this hotel during my next visit."
50,"This Hotel is a well run and a protected Hotel- security to watch the help and security for the guests protection, Help galore around this hotel for any comfort you may want, they will even pick you up at the airport. We didn't stay out late but walked all over the city during the day, there are guards everywhere for anybody's protection. We even went to the central Market, were all the venders are, pefectly safe mingeling with the natives. We think in general that Guatemala has got alot of negitve press and one sided negitive stuff. Use common sence as if you were at home in any North American City like NYC or any large City. As I read some of the other comments a Traveler said it was a smoking hotel Well I want to tell you you must go out side to smoke, there is no smoking or"
30,"Barceló Premium Guatemala is a big five star hotel rated at first place in TriAdvisor and has all the conditions to maintain the place, good rooms, bathroom not so good but enough, not free internet, very good breakfast, and luxuriant lobby.. However we were expecting more. In fact we arrived at 9 pm and nobody help us with the bags, they remain looking at us not helping, we come in and we didn´t see the reception and again nobody help us, we saw the reception because was a queue there, we went there we had been waiting and when our time arrived the things were fast but again nobody said us were the lifts were or helped us with the bags or come with us to show were the room was.Again in the morning no information about were the breakfast was or helped us to find a table.

40,"My mom, sister and I stayed here through our tour with Gate 1 Travel. I could not believe how friendly everybody was at the hotel, I have to tell you what a difference to a hotel in the United States! We had 3 people in a room, so we opted for a roll-a-way bed, which was the size of a full bed and very comfortable. We were able to go the the business center and they helped us make reservations for a nice dinner in the city, they also helped us order a pizza one night. Out last day we spent by the pool, which was heated (what a treat). I was very pleased with everything at the Barcelo!"
20,"This hotel is very convenient to the airport and is priced very well. It's best feature is a lovely big pool and hot tub.   Despite the hotel appearing quiet they could not offer me a non-smoking room, and the room we were given stunk of cigarrete smoke. I can only assume that the hotel is basically pro-smoking and does not have many non-smoking rooms.  If you are a smoker, or are not fussed by the smell of tobaco, then this hotel would be fine for you. But for me and my family, it was a bad choice"
50,"Great music on 97.7. on the in room Sony alarm clock radio.... Fantastic breakfast buffet  staff:  Jennifer, Candy (makes great omelets any way you want!!!!), Carlos, Monica, Mauricio, Luis, and Francisco.  Cleaning staff did a super job:  Dona, Brenda and Claudia were all great!  Sergio, Rodrigo, Regina and Andrea represented the front desk with excellence.   Bryan and all the bell boys always greeted us with a smile.  We were pleasantly surprised on New Years' Day with a complimentary bottle of Ron Zacapa rum........THANK YOU!!!!!!!!  Pool was heated, jacuzzi was nice & warm (open 24hrs.) and  a pleasant end to a day of traveling on the road .  Breakfast buffet, be sure and try the Banana Leaf wrapped tamales, was superb and had different ""local recipes"" each day  along with "
50,"Besides that everything was OK in the hotel, the main highlight was the huge HEATED swimming pool.  Add up the hot Jacuzzi and shower and you understand why we’ve spent there all free time.  To make it even better – the pool are open almost 24 hours."
50,"Excellent hotel. Stayed here twice during a recent visit to Guatemala. This hotel had far, far more class than we expected. Found out it used to be the Marriott. Beautiful pool & lounging area. View from our rooms was outstanding! City views, & in the distance the landing path for the airport. All stunning at night. Quality of food in the hotel restaurants excellent, & service as well. Overall, great ambience & a great place to stay. Rooms were likewise outstanding. Spacious, well-appointed, with immaculate bathrooms. Very, very pleased. We'll stay there again. A very safe, inviting environment!"
40,"The Barcelo in Guatemala City is an oasis in a very difficult town.  They meet you at the airport, provide a vast breakfast buffet, box breakfasts and lunches for early departures, and have great bathroom amenities from Aveda.  Complimentary combs, toothbrushes/toothpaste, and razors/shaving cream are all provided in each room, in case airport security or delayed luggage has yours.  A shoehorn was welcome, and brought to the airports to help put on shoes after airport security.  Try the Chicken Soup in the restaurant."
50,This is a great hotel with all you could ask for except on the weekends it is a convention center with many affairs going on at the same time (with many outside bands)..it is quite noisey until about 11:00......otherwise it was a wonderful place to stay..great breakfast and within walking distance of many hotels and restaurants..food market about 3 minute walk..the area is very safe in the day time..we took restaurant shulltles at night..there is also a hotel shuttle to Fontabella Plaza...great place with many wonderful restaurants to choose from..have fun
40,"My Husband and I traveled here from Oregon.  I had never been to Guatemala, and was extremely apprehensive due to the violence we kept hearing of on the news.  I felt safe the whole time I was at the hotel.  We stayed 3 days at the Barcelo.  The hotel picked us up at the airport and took us straight to the hotel with no problems.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comforting.  The staff is friendly and were willing to help with anything.  Most of the staff spoke English.  The restaurants are great too. Word of warning: If you want a quiet hotel - this is not for you.  This is an extremely busy hotel with lots going on."
50,We were finishing a trip into the Highlands for a medical mission trip and had seen a lot of rough housing.  What a joy to finish our trip in this luxury!  The buffet was amazing with local tastes well represented to get a feel of Guatemalan food.    This was formerly a Marriott and has maintained a high degree of quality in all aspects.
50,"The hotel is part of a chain with upscale properties throughout the world. (Including the US; you'd be surprised at some of the American-named properties which are actually owned by the Barcelo Family.)    In any event, we got a good price on a rooms prior to an late evening layover in Guatemala City before a morning return to the US.  Shuttle driver was waiting for us at the airport on Friday evening.  Hotel check in process was flawless with one exception--my traveling companion was ushered into a room which was already occupied.  Apologies were extended--and she was upgraded to a penthouse suite.  I languished on the 6th floor on my fine sheets, comfortable bed and pillows, watching the flat screen TV with ample channels.  Many of the travel ammenities found their way to my"
40,"Great hotel with one exception. The area around the hotel at night is not safe to walk.A taxi to nearby restaurants is,$5.00.We did not think the restaurant,Cacao,was that good.The sports bar in the hotel was OK.We had to catch the 6AM shuttle for a early morning flight.We checked the night before with the front desk,your desk,& business center office,all agreed the restaurant opens at 5AM.We were there at 5AM.It was not open.At 5:10,checked with the front desk.At 5:20,ordered room service for the lobby.At 5:45,coffee & croissant arrived.Several others also upset.This was ,October 16."
50,"I have to write something, because our staying was outstanding, beautiful pool, massive gym(s), great restaurants, very polite and helpful staff what else can I say. If the Hotel is your first step into the guatemalan experience with your partner in a romantic trip, make sure you get the Champaign and strawberries as the alternative option offered when you book trhoug the internet its a great value. They have a sports bar downstairs with great gallo draft beer that is another must try, if you are really keen in the Japanese restaurant do it but iI think that the same Kyoto restaurant that the Barcelo hotel in Managua have is better but the one here is still ok, I hope you like it, Have fun   The chuchis  Panama & Australia"
40,"The Barcelo is decent value for money. The hotel stay includes a free breakfast, and two-way airport transfer. The hotel also has many amenities, like a swimming pool, a pretty impressive gym, a futsal court, amongst others.  It is located near zone 10, where the nightlife is supposed to be at, and less than 10 minutes from the airport. It is, however, far from the historic center of town. (about 20 min taxi ride)  However, there are lots of fastfoods like McDonald's, and KFC just beside the hotel, so you won't go hungry."
30,"The rooms where clean, and the service was ok, the beds are really hard.  The hotel felt really safe, but not alot around it for the tourist.  The cost of room service was through the roof an very very slow."
50,Really nice rooms with all the amenities for a super price.  The buffet breakfast which was included in our senior citizen rate was unbelievable.  It was only 5 minutes from the airport.  The only drawback was expensive drinks at the bar.
50,"I stayed at this hotel only one night. Rooms were large and beautifully furnished. Bathrooms with brand new towels and various cosmetics, also coffee and tea machine. I had a beautiful balcony overlooking the pool and surrounding buildings (nothing special). Beds very comfortable and clean, with white crisp linen. Staff speaks very good English which is very rare in Guatemala The hotel has free transportation to and from the airport every hour and a free ride to the mall. I ate dinner in the buffet restaurant, was very good and service excellent. This hotel has floors for smokers and no smokers.  I highly recommend this place. This hotel has everything you can desire and more"
30,"Location is in Zona 9, not advised to walk around but hotel has great service, good food, rooms with balconies, etc."
40,"Two friends and I traveled to Guatemala with Gate 1.  The hotel in Guatemala City was perfect, with helpful staff, a lovely (and inexpensive) spa, a great pool, and a good location.  After our first day relaxing, we boarded the bus with Walter as our guide.  Walter gave us interesting information on the scenic and beautiful drive to Antigua, where we saw beautiful churches, great views, and had free time for lunch.  We then went on to Chichicastanengo, a wonderful Mayan city with a lot of character.  Our hotel there, the Mayan Inn was architectually fascinating, though the rooms smelled musty and were not the best lit or most comfortable.  However, it was clearly the best hotel in the area, and the staff was very helpful.  Don't miss a trip to the cemetery if you go!  The next"
50,"This upscale hotel was part of our 5 day package from Gate 1 Travel.  Gate 1 Travel was excellent about booking our trip to Guatemala with day tours to Antigua and Lake Atitlan including an awesome overnight in Chichicastenango at the Mayan Inn.  This particular hotel was in a very nice and safe area of Guatemala City with various restaurant within a walking distance.  The hotel personnel was efficient, professional and very courteous. The hotel is well maintained with a nice pool area and the rooms are excellent. The breakfast buffet (included with the room) is simply spectacular with many international and local dishes.  I definitelly recommend Gate 1 Travel to book your trip to Guatemala and this nice hotel."
20,"I am unable to find a quiet hotel in Guatemala and the Barcelo was also noisy.  I left the clarion suites because of the noise and moved to the Barcelo.  At first I thought it was good until around 9.00pm the Convention Center gets going with the thumping disco music which goes on all night.  Take away the noise from the Convention center and it would be ok.  The rooms are nice, clean and well appointed.  The staff seem to be ok.  The internet connection was useless, very slow – also you need to ring the reception each time you want to connect and they charge $10 per day.  Room service was quick and the food good.  I liked the pool as it was nice and big and no one seemed to be using it."
50,"The hotel was elegant and clean, the service was first class.  Incredible pool and spa area. Gourmet fare with astounding buffet.   Friendly, professional, very visible staff treated us like royalty. Excellent amenities.  Close proximity to airport.  Shuttle service hourly.  ATM/Debit machine in lobby.   My travel partner and I were placed in the newer tower; our friends in the older tower.  The older section was very clean and equally well-appointed but it was, well, older! So, if possible, ask to be placed in the new tower.   Safe -- you must insert your room key in the elevator in order to push the button to that floor."
40,"Hotel is in Zone 9, closest to the airport so you can hear the aircraft engines roar, sometimes at 1am. WIndows are not soundproofed so you can also hear the hotel's central air conditioning plant late at night from the seventh floor, if your room overlooks that side.  Having stayed at the Intercontinental a few blocks away in Zone 10, the Barcelo is dated and definitely not in the same league. However, the breakfast and lunch buffets are very good, and the corporate room rate is much lower. It is nice to be able to check in for your AA flight at the office in the hotel and avoid the long line at the airport."
30,"If this feels like a conventional American hotel, such as the Marriot, it is because it was an M until just recently. There really is not a lot here that is distinctive or special.  There are lots of cafes, shops, services, etc., as one would expect. And it is clean and well maintained.  But there were lots of things that were surprisingly deficient. The room does not come with a mini-bar key, nor are you offered one at check in. You have to call for it once you get to your room. (And the mini-bar had no orange juice -- that was a first!!)  There are no instructions for internet access -- so again you have to call for that. When you are given an internet password (for $10), you are not told there is more information you will have to enter. SO, you have to call back AGAIN!  The"
50,"I was extemely surprised by the cleanliness of this hotel.  It was 10 minutes from the hotel, in which the hotel had a free shuttle.  The pool was amazing and the staff was bilingual."
50,"Stayed here for 3 nights inbetween visiting Antigua and Tikal. Good business class hotel with excellent facilities and choice of 3 restaurants including a Japanese restaurant. The rooms are good with comfortable beds and the 2 rooms I stayed in had balconies but the 1st was too noisy to sit out because of hum from the air con. units below, so ask for a room at the front. The staff were helpful when needed and there is an hourly airport shuttle, all good. The only minus is that although it is only 1 block away from zone 10 [zone viva] to walk you have to cross about 8 lanes of traffic [not all in 1 go] so allow extra time or get a cab."
50,"I was just about to book somewhere else and saw this deal from Gate 1 travel, 5 day classic Guatemala staying three nights at the Barcelo.  Would go back again just for the breakfasts!  An oasis in a busy city with gentle piano recitals in the evening.  The hotel was wonderful, I loved the room and the staff couldn't do enough to be helpful.  When vacating my room I lost my jewellery and the room attendant searched extensively until he found it.  I didn't go out in the evenings but walked around alone for three hours one afternoon and felt safe and confident.  It rained quite a bit which had been forecast but it didn't stop me having a great time.  The free hourly shuttle to the nearby airport was a bonus.  I don't know how Gate 1 put the trip together at the price to include a"
40,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights with the Gate 1 tour of Guatemala. The location was wonderful. It was situated right next to the tourist area, city centre, Oakland Shopping Mall and many major international fast food restaurants. There was a breakfast buffet inclusive in the package which exceeded our expectations. Ultimately, this hotel stay was a very good value."
50,"Our trip brought us to Guatemala the day after the volcano blew its top and in the midst of a large tropical depression that brought more rain than we've ever experienced.  The airport was closed so we flew into San Salvador and were driven to Guatemala.  After over 8 hours we arrived late at night.  The staff at the Barcelo Hotel were welcoming, professional and exceptional in every way, as was the hotel itself.  The Barcelo proved clean, comfortable and quite elegant and the included  substantial breakfast was excellent. Clark Tours and American Airlines were located in the hotel lobby.  This convenience enhanced our trip and when the sun emerged we set out for some of the wonders of Guatemala."
50,"I arrived at the Barcelo the Day Tropical Storm Agatha came through. I have many great things to say about this hotel. First the breakfast buffet is great, good food and great dinning room, outside or inside. The pool looked great but I was unable to use it since it was full of ash from the Vocanic explosion. The rooms where neat and clean and the staff was always, always helpful and attentive. The location is great since you are only 2 or 3 blocks from the Camino Real and can walk or if you feel unsafe take a taxi for 5 to 7 dollars. There is not a lot to do in Guatemala City but the Hotel comes thorugh. I did not try the Japenease resturant, Strykers was a good pub/bar and the evening Buffet was not worth it. Though the Hotel has resturants you are so much better off trying"
10,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed in Barcelo Guatemala City after our flight to Los Angeles was cancelled due to a nearby volcanic eruption.   The hotel itself is lovely with a polished, luxurious feel to the grand lobby and comfortable rooms. There is an outdoor pool (although it was covered in ash at the time), a beauty salon, spa, fitness centers, meeting rooms, restaurants, gift shops and bars. Initially I was charmed by the hotel and happy to be staying there. The hotel setting itself is not the reason I am giving it a bad review.  The major problem with this hotel is the staff - they clearly do not care about their guests and turned out to be extremely unknowledgeable and unwilling to provide any sort of assistance with the challenges that were presented to us when the"
50,"We originally stayed at the Westin for business but were put up at the Barcelo the next 2 nights after our flight was cancelled.  THE GOOD:  -Location - close to airport  -Staff - super helpful and friendly (even in the face of hundreds of stranded travelers)  -Price - we paid $105/night including breakfast after having paid $235 the night before at the Westin (we liked Barcelo better). Food was more affordable than the Westin, too.  -Dining options - good restaurant with an outside patio, lobby lounge, Japanese restaurant and a sports bar called Strikers with lots of good pub type food options and a good atmosphere. There are also a few good places to walk to within a couple of blocks.  -Decent fitness center and pool area.  THE BAD:  -They charge for business center access. "
30,"Our room was ok nothing special but the toiletries (toothbrush, razors, shoe horns, sewing kit, shoe shine sponge, shower cap, etc) were excellent. Our room had a king bed that was like a rock, if you threw your suitcase on the bed it didn't bounce and the pillows did not move. Rooms are a bit dated with cracked molding and a layer of dirt along the baseboards and our sheets were dirty upon arrival, so at best this is more like a bad Best Western hotel in terms of the room. Now the front desk representatives are just rude except for one lady who greets everyone as they walk by. Also there was complete confusion at the front desk when we tried to order the breakfast box for the next day for pickup; they were trying to charge us four dollars per person even though it was included."
50,"We chose this hotel based on location, reviews and price.  It has all the amenities plus that one needs when traveling.  We considered other hotels, including the Westin, but settled on the Barcelo because we could get a junior suite for the same price as a single elsewhere. The suite was 2 stories with a connecting circular staircase (not narrow) on the top floors of the taller tower.  Both floors afforded great views of the city and the mountains and volcanoes beyond.  The first floor was a living room with a sofa and chair, dining table, desk and television armoire.  It also had a bathroom with shower.  The sofa was a sleeper so the suite could be occupied by more than 2 people. The second story is a bedroom with full bathroom.  The bed was quite comfortable and there was a"
50,"My husband and I had purchased the bargain Gait-1 Travel 5-day package and loved the Barcello's location so near the airport. We got the older tower and had a view of Agua Volcano and the colonial aquaduct, which edges the north side of the airport, our first night.       On our return from 2 days sightseeing the parking lot view wasn't as inspiring -- but very quiet. Actually the sliding glass door did an excellent job of blocking street noise, and our neighbors were either quiet or the walls did a good job too.       Both rooms and bathrooms were comfortable and clean although we were visiting family so spent little time there. The mini-fridge is locked, and we didn't bother using it - just got ice from the machine down the hall for an evening cocktail. Pluses included apples"
40,"Went on a 5 day excursion with Gate1travel.com and this hotel was great. Stayed for 3 nights(total).  There were 3 women in our room (our request) and we had 2 queen beds and a really nice size rollaway bed (comfortable too).  The multiple pillows are comfortable and the bed firm.  There are nice items in the bathroom and they brought us extra towels on request.  They give you a bottle or two of water also.  We stayed in one room for 1 night and had a minibar, then another room for 2 nights with just a refrigerator.  There are robes and slippers in the closet for use too.  The pool is nice but the jacuzzi did not work during our stay.  There is a bar by the pool and they have waitress service by the pool.  You can order food from the STRIKERS bar too.    My sister had an hour"
40,"The Barcelo has everything you might need located inside it's 2 towers.  The neighborhood is a bit scary and located quite close to the airport.  We were not adventurous enough to go out at night.   The hotel has security posted at each entrance, gate, as well as the elevators.  The main hotel tower has the deluxe rooms with upgraded bathrooms, while the back tower has the standard rooms which have very tiny bathrooms with tubs that don't drain well, hairdryers that don't work, and noise from the street if you open your balcony window.   The buffet breakfast is fantastic and has everything to suit a traveler's needs.  The Sports Bar serves very reasonable priced meals by American Standards.  While you await your meal or drinks, they serve you fresh popped popcorn in a basket. "
50,"My friend and I stayed here for three nights during mid-April.  There's were so many great things about this hotel, good location (it's in the middle of the city), great service from staff, wonderful amenities!    I had purchased the 5 day package from gate1.com, and they definitely had set me up at the right hotel.  The room was clean!  The bathroom was well stocked with anything you might need (with a bottle of complimentry water each day).  My stay came with free breakfast!  Barcelo had an extensive buffet selection.  They served both hot and cold meals.  They even had a lady who made fresh omlets to order.  I believe breakfast times were from 7am thru 11am.  Here's a little tip,  If you are heading out for the day, you can even request that they pack you a boxed lunch to go"
50,"I recommend this hotel to anyone, the location is close to the airport, but we didn't experience any noise whatsoever.  The rooms were cleaned, but the bed a bit hard, the breakfast buffet was included in our package every morning and it was great, they had alot of varieties, including somewhat tipical food.  We traveled with our 5 year old, and she enjoyed the pool, as it was clean and the water was heated.  The area is secured as it is surrounded by other hotels and we felt very comfortable walking a bit late at night.  Guatemala is a country not many visit or know about, and I will highly recommend not just the hotel Barcelo, but visiting Guatemala with the gate1.com promotions and take advantage of the clark tours there in the hotel, as they have the best tour guides ever!!!!"
50,I have been in many hotels in Central America and the Caribbean during the past 13 years for business travel and beleive this hotel is a great place to stay for business or pleasure when in Guatemala City and have reasonable fares and top service compared to any other in the region.
50,"If this place is in your price range it's very nice. Great clean rooms, only complaint is they smell like smoke. I stayed here 2 separate nights (one at the start and one at the end of my trip) and both rooms were beautiful but a bit smoky. I hear the breakfast is fabulous but didn't have time to get it when it was included and didn't want to pay when it wasn't. It's just 2 blocks from the Zona Viva, across a busy street but one with traffic lights so if you're not afraid of walking around in Guatemala City that gives you easy access to great food and nightlife.  Highly recommend Casa Chapina for dinner in Zona Viva. And check out a few clubs if you are there on a weekend  night."
50,"customer service one of the best, very friendly staff, waiter, housekeeper, hostess, front desk etc."
50,"I have been to Guatemala 4 times. this time my mom came with. currently living here. and the service was the most excellent of all the places ive stayed. very attentive employees, who are eager to help at any moment. we didnt eat at either of the restaurants. The gift shop has a very good selection of typical artisan gifts. The location is perfect. in walking distance of malls and many restuarants clubs, grocery stores."
50,"We took a trip to Guatemala in Jan. 2010 with Gate 1 and loved it.  TACA Airlines was great, Barcelo Hotel in Guatemala City was great, tour to Antigua and market in Chichicastenenga were mindboggling, our guide was great and our group was fabulous.  We had a lot of fun. After the Gate 1 tour, we stayed another 5 days in Guatemala City.  Saw our sponsored child through Children International for the first time after having her for 14 years. That was wonderful.  Visited the Zoo TWICE, it was so enjoyable.  Walked all over the city.  Didn't find it as dangerous as what people said.  Found the Guatemalan people to be very friendly and helpful and appreciative of anything you give them.  And the arts and crafts items in that country are incredible."
50,"This hotel is just perfection. Gorgeous foyer, beautiful rooms, all the amenities and toiletries you can possibly ask for, and superbly comfortable beds. Located in the ""safe"" part of Guatemala (zone 9), this hotel is only about a 10 min drive from the airport and they have a shuttle. Service was excellent. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet: fantastic selection of food and beautiful outdoor setting. I truly don't think this hotel could get any better!"
50,I stayed overnight while in route to Tikal. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the airport. They start as early as 4 am. The shuttles are located the exit gate at arrivals. The drivers are friendly. It is less than a 10 minute drive depending on traffic. The hotel area is safe. We walked to Cacao for a great dinner. The hotel provides all the toiletries you need. Has a large pool and plenty of restaurants. The check in and out was quick. The rooms are large and clean. Good hotel for the money. I used expedia to get a better rate.
50,"I stayed at the Barcelo between Christmas and New Year's. Things were very quiet while I was there. I got a great deal on Expedia of only $63 per night. For that price, I got an outstanding room equal to any 4 star hotel in the US. The only (slight) detractors were the size of the room and the slightly dated fixtures in the bathroom. But, everything was spotlessly clean and operated properly. The room was well decorated with a nice bed, desk, and sitting area.   The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. I took advantage of the airport shuttle service -- it was right on time and very convenient. The hotel also has two different ATM's in their lobby (covering both Cirrus and Plus cards) so you can easily and safely get cash from from inside the hotel.  The hotel's location is"
40,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff is nothing but polite and friendly. The restaurant was reasonably priced. It is conveniently located near the airport. If you have to stay in Guatemala City, stay here."
50,"Hotel is on Par with any 4-star hotel in the US.  Free shuttle to Airport.  Check was quick easy and painless.  Staff was very pleasant and all spoke fluent english.  Rooms were clean and well maintained.  Food was good for a hotel.  Nice facilities in the hotel. i.e. Sports Bar, Internet Cafe, gift shops etc.  Staff recommend great restaurant with authentic Guatemalan food.   Very safe hotel with lots of security."
50,"Free shuttles wait for flights and the hotel is a ten minute drive from the airport. (Don´t change money at the airport as you get a terrible rate. You get a better rate at hotel or better yet at a bank outside the hotel.)  I paid about $90 for a superior single room on Expedia and for that I got a reasonably sized  room with two queen sized beds and a small balcony (breakfast was not included). The bathroom was small and the plumbing fixtures a bit old but fine. The room was spotless. Only drawback was that although I had booked a non smoking room, I was given a room on a smoking floor. My room didn´t smell too bad but whenever the person in the room next to me smoked, I smelt it. I then decided to stay another night and got a standard room for $70 including breakfast by"
40,"I recently spend 4 days in Guatemala city (out of a total of 9 in Guatemala) and while I suggest spending only a couple if your on vacation, if you have to stay in Guatemala city it has it's charms and several things to keep you occupied. The Barcelo Hotel was a very good value for the money and is in a safe secure area very close to the main action in Zona 10 just a 5 minute walk away (though you will cross a couple of very busy streets).   The hotel gym and spa was excellent and there are plenty of food options on site. The breakfast buffet was also one of the best I've experienced in Latin America, a real treat.   The rooms were relatively quiet (full disclosure, I live in noisy Manhattan area) with soundproofed windows and no thumping disco music or noisy neighbors while I"
50,"I give this hotel 9 out of 10.   First, the good:  - heavenly beds and linens - fantastic RainForest-type of shower - courteous staff - delicious food - located in a safe area close to entertainment - all the toiletries you can possibly think of  The not-so-good: - they provide shoeshine and floss but no lotion? I thought that was the basics in all the hotels - if you want a good view, you should request it, otherwise you'll be looking at a tin roof - every morning when I ordered tea instead of coffee, I got iced tea and was charged extra for it. Of course, the staff was very accommodating and remedied the issue, but it's still annoying.  All in all, good hotel, great value!"
50,"First, the food in the breakfast buffet (not included in price) was one of the best. Local and traditional breakfast foods. I loved waking up every morning for that. The rooms are very clean and with great water pressure in the showers. The beds are very comfortable with clean sheets.  There are alot of families that stay there so it can be loud at times, especially in the very crowded pool. Walking distance to Zona Viva."
40,"my girlfriend and i spent 4nights here a few weeks back. We originally booked for 2nights, but opted 2stay for an extra 2!  The hotel is pretty luxurious and is pretty much self-contained. It has a great pool and hot-tub, 3 different restaurants, gift shops, travel/tour operators, even a hairdresser and massage service. The buffet breakfast and dinner options were great, but we also tried the sports bar 1 night and that was great too. The staff were very helpful and all spoke perfect english- helpful if your spanish isn't that great. The location is in zona 9, just on the edge of zona 10, where all the restaurants and nightlife is.  In fact the only problem we found was the cost of internet access from the business centre. Having travelled in canada and the states, just expected"
50,Excellent hotel. Great pool. My wife and I had dinner at the Italian resturant one night. Excellent food and wine at this place. The hotel also has a sports bar with a live band every Thursday nights. Highly recommend this place.
50,"After spending a week in San Pedro La Laguna on a missions assignment, the wife and I decided to stay at the Barcelo prior to flying out the next day. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by a wonderful and friendly staff. Our check-in was great! Jaqueline helped us out and even found us a room on a higher floor. The hotel itself is second to none. Great decor,wonderful atmosphere, and amenities of a 5 star hotel. The room itself was by far what the doctor ordered! Soft comfortable beds, clean carpet (one of my pet peaves) and a bathroom you feel comfortable using. In addition, the bathroom has all the little personals such as a vanity kit, shaving kit, etc you may need. We were extremely tired so we decided that would eat in one of the restaurants in the hotel. We"
50,"We are residents in Guatemala City and we wanted an out of the usual weekends going out to party. We arrived friday afternoon (holiday) and the Staff was very receptive and highly compliant. We wanted to order pizza for dinner and the reception made all the inquires so we got to eat Domino's at our room. Later at night we went out partying and the parking staff was highly aware and pendant of we coming back so we didn't had problems of the late entrance.   @ Midnight we ordered champagne and strawberrys w/chocolate and the service was incredibly fast. And in the morning, when we needed to attend a graduation, we found in the room all what we needed: iron, shoe polish cloth, sewing kit. We even asked for bath ropes and they were sent right away.  Overall the breakfast was more"
50,"After backpacking throughout Guatemala for 2 weeks, the Barcelo was a God send!!!  Check in was swift, porter service was great, and airport shuttle was an added plus!  All the employees were personable and approachable.  They seemed to be sincerely interested in making your stay memorable, enjoyable and stress free.  We had a room with 2 double beds - clean, comfortable and restful.  Would highly recommend Barcelo Guatemala City!"
50,"We had to get a last minute room at Hotel Barcelo after the highly rated Hotel Tikal Futura cancelled our reservation for someone with cash in hand at the registration desk...unfortunately a common occurence in too many Guatemalan hotels. Our room was spotless with an in-room safe, in-room bar, extensive bath samples, large TV and a heated pool that closed late in the evening.  I really liked the fact that the business office with printers and modern computers was open late also so I could check my email(unlike some hotels who close these services at 5pm). Wi-Fi is available for a reasonable daily charge which makes that notebook/netbook come in handy.      The best part of our stay was the included breakfast buffet which was the best we had in all of Guatemala(try fresh"
40,"My daughter and I highly recommend this hotel. The staff is very warm and friendly and eager to be of assistance. The VIP room is excellent and we especially enjoyed the staff. This privilege comes with the deluxe suite and is well worth the price. One never needs to leave this hotel as every amenity is available. The only negative we found was that the sports bar neglected to get our order in a timely manner and we did not have time to enjoy a meal there. However, the manager apoligized for their error and all was forgiven. We love the staff and recommend this hotel. The staff works very hard to accomodate everyone."
10,"Unfotunately my company chooses this hotel for me to stay, I am sure they are cheaper than others as everything else about it is cheap. I have stayed there when it was a Marriott and it was bad service, bad efficiency, to conduct business in the lobby is impossible as the hotel is full of young parents with extended stay for adoption puropses!!. Neither the personel nor the entire hotel is designed to serve the business traveller, they are desgined to cater adoption couples. With my recent stay I can say that nothing has changed. It is dissapointing that they keep adverstining the hotel caters the business community when it does not. Inefficient and bad service!!."
20,"We had stayed 3 times previously at the Marriott Guatemala City.  The first time was excellent with each stayed a little less nice then the first (things getting worn and such).  The last stay was in October 2008 to finalize the adoption of our daughter.  As before we reserved the bi-level suite which comes with the breakfast buffet and executive lounge privlages.  When we arrived everything with our room was fine.  We went to the executive lounge and was told that no children are allowed.  (Mind you, if our children are not quite and well mannered we would leave as we do not want to disturb other people).  So we took some snacks to bring to our room and were told that was not allowed either.   We spoke with several management employees at the hotel including the general manager"
30,"We booked this stay using Marriott reward points originally, but when it converted to the Barcelo right before we came they promised to honor the points.  They ended up charging us a $15 fee for this, but big deal.  The price was right.  The hotel is a normal big corporate hotel; the concierge wasn't that knowledgeable, though.  For example, we were told the restaurant Kacao (in the Zona Viva) was open all the time -- nope, only open starting at 6 pm.  This wouldn't have annoyed me so much except that all the guidebooks advise that Guate is rife with crime and not a place to walk around in.  We didn't have any problems, but it did raise my anxiety level.  The rooms were okay, a bit musty smelling.  It was very close to the airport, but if I were paying for somewhere to stay in"
50,"We were there in Sept 2008 while it was still a Marriott.  It was wonderful.  The front desk staff was very helpful and did speak English.  There was also a baby lounge there where we spent many hours everyday. The lounge was well equipped with toys and had free internet access (slow but free). There were several restaurants on site and they were all good. The gift shops were also well stocked and friendly.  You can get better prices on souvenirs at the handicraft market, but they still weren't too bad in the gift shops.  There is a shopping mall just a short walk away and the zoo is also very close. We were always well cared for and always felt safe behind the wall of the Marriott.  We will always remember the Marriott fondly as it was the place we met our son and became a"
